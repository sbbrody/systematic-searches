Note: I quickly tried the CINAHL search in EconLit and PsycInfo, as these are both EBSCO databases and could offer additional papers on implementation. EconLit had only two references retrieved and these were not relevant to the question. PsycInfo retrieved 223 results on August 2, 2021. However, the relevant results were already retrieved in other searches, as I determined by searching the Covidence project. 

Able to export the 1,444 results from OVID MEDLINE and upload to Covidence on August 5, 2021.
