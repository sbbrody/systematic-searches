Title
  Learning From Strengths: Improving Care by Comparing Perinatal Approaches Between Japan and Canada and Identifying Future Research Priorities.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Preterm birth (PTB) is the leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Canada and Japan each have strengths that can inform clinical decision-making, research, and health care policy regarding the prevention of PTB and its sequelae. Our objectives were to: 1) compare PTB rates, risk factors, management, and outcomes between Japan and Canada; 2) establish research priorities while fostering future collaborative opportunities; and 3) undertake knowledge translation of these findings.

   METHODS: We conducted a literature review to identify publications that examined PTB rates, risk factors, prevention and management techniques, and outcomes in Japan and Canada. We conducted site visits at 4 Japanese tertiary centres and held a collaborative stakeholder meeting of parents, neonatologists, maternal-fetal medicine specialists, and researchers.

   RESULTS: Japan reports lower rates of PTB, neonatal mortality, and several PTB risk factors than Canada. However, Canadian PTB data is population-based, whereas, in Japan, the rate of PTB is population-based, but outcomes are not. Rates of severe neurologic injury and necrotizing enterocolitis were lower in Japan, while Canada's rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity were lower. PTB prevention approaches differed, with less progesterone use in Japan and more long-term tocolysis. In Japan, there were lower rates of neonatal transfers and non-faculty overnight care, but also less use of antenatal corticosteroids and deferred cord clamping. Research priorities identified through the stakeholder meeting included early skin-to-skin contact, parental well-being after PTB, and transitions in care for the child.

   CONCLUSION: We identified key differences between Japan and Canada in the factors affecting PTB management and patient outcomes, which can inform future research efforts.

Title
  Skin-to-skin contact to improve premature mothers' anxiety and stress state: A meta-analysis. [Review]
Abstract
  Premature mothers present more anxiety and stress after delivery, which may be caused by mother-infant separation while hospitalised. Skin-to-skin contact (SSC), a mitigating factor for mother-infant separation, can benefit infants and mothers in many ways, but few studies focused on its efficacy on maternal anxiety and stress states. Therefore, this review aims to evaluate the effect of SSC on anxiety and stress. Comprehensive research was conducted in nine databases. Meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the effect of SSC, and subgroup analyses were performed to explain the sources of heterogeneity. Eight randomised controlled trials with 728 participants were included, and SSC significantly reduced the level of anxiety ([standardised mean difference, SMD] -0.72; 95% CI -1.08 to -0.35) and stress state ([SMD] -0.84; 95% CI -1.59 to -0.09). One subgroup analysis revealed that SSC can relieve anxiety if performing SSC no less than 1 h per day ([SMD] -0.94; 95% CI -1.34 to -0.53). Another subgroup analysis suggested that applying SSC repeatedly and lasting less than 1 week ([SMD] -1.49; 95% CI -2.31 to -0.66) or for 1 week to 2 weeks ([SMD] -1.04; 95% CI -1.29 to -0.79) can significantly reduce maternal anxiety level but no significance if lasting over 2 weeks ([SMD] -0.33; 95% CI -0.67 to 0.01). SSC can effectively improve anxiety and stress states among premature mothers after delivery, and not definitive finding presents that only SSC that was performed no less than 60 min could improve postpartum anxiety states, while SSC alone was not as effective when carried out over 2 weeks.

Title
  Effects of single family room architecture on parent-infant closeness and family centered care in neonatal environments-a single-center pre-post study.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a single family room architecture in a neonatal intensive care unit (SFR-NICU) on parents' presence, parent-infant skin-to-skin contact (SSC) and the quality of family centered care.

   STUDY DESIGN: Two cohorts of parents of preterm infants were compared: those in the unit before and after the move to SFR-NICU. The parents used daily diaries to report their presence and SSC, and they responded to daily text message questions about the quality of family centered care.

   RESULTS: Parents spent more time in the SFR-NICU, but no significant change was found in SSC. Parents rated the quality of family centered care highly in both unit architectures, without a change in rating after the move.

   CONCLUSION: The SFR-NICU increased parents' presence but not SSC. The change in architecture did not affect parents' evaluations of the quality of family centered care, which was already highly rated before the move.

Title
  Systematic review shows the benefits of involving the fathers of preterm infants in early interventions in neonatal intensive care units. [Review]
Abstract
  AIM: This review identifies interventions involving the fathers of preterm infants that have been tested in neonatal intensive care units (NICU). It examines their effects on the fathers and infants and highlights any differences between fathers and mothers who took part in the same interventions.

   METHODS: A systematic search was performed in English from 1995 to 1 September 2020, using the CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, PubMed and PsycINFO databases. We examined 14 peer-reviewed studies that investigated NICU interventions involving 478 fathers, whose 511 infants were born before 37 weeks of gestation. These included empirical studies with clinical outcomes.

   RESULTS: Studies on fathers' interventions in NICUs were limited and mainly restricted to basic skin-to-skin contact or tactile interventions. The interventions had similar general positive effects on mothers and fathers when it came to infant physiological and behavioural reactions. There was also evidence of a positive effect on the fathers, including their mental health.

   CONCLUSION: Including fathers as active partners in the care of their preterm newborn infants produced good outcomes for both of them. Further research is needed to develop new, multimodal and interactive interventions that provide fathers with positive contact with their preterm infants. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

Title
  Delivery Room Interventions for Hypothermia in Preterm Neonates: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis.
Abstract
  Importance: Prevention of hypothermia in the delivery room is a cost-effective, high-impact intervention to reduce neonatal mortality, especially in preterm neonates. Several interventions for preventing hypothermia in the delivery room exist, of which the most beneficial is currently unknown.

   Objective: To identify the delivery room thermal care intervention that can best reduce neonatal hypothermia and improve clinical outcomes for preterm neonates born at 36 weeks' gestation or less.

   Data Sources: MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, and CINAHL databases were searched from inception to November 5, 2020.

   Study Selection: Randomized and quasi-randomized clinical trials of thermal care interventions in the delivery room for preterm neonates were included. Peer-reviewed abstracts and studies published in non-English language were also included.

   Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data from the included trials were extracted in duplicate using a structured proforma. A network meta-analysis with bayesian random-effects model was used for data synthesis.

   Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were core body temperature and incidence of moderate to severe hypothermia on admission or within the first 2 hours of life. Secondary outcomes were incidence of hyperthermia, major brain injury, and mortality before discharge. The 9 thermal interventions evaluated were (1) plastic bag or plastic wrap covering the torso and limbs with the head uncovered or covered with a cloth cap; (2) plastic cap covering the head; (3) skin-to-skin contact; (4) thermal mattress; (5) plastic bag or plastic wrap with a plastic cap; (6) plastic bag or plastic wrap along with use of a thermal mattress; (7) plastic bag or plastic wrap along with heated humidified gas for resuscitation or for initiating respiratory support in the delivery room; (8) plastic bag or plastic wrap along with an incubator for transporting from the delivery room; and (9) routine care, including drying and covering the body with warm blankets, with or without a cloth cap.

   Results: Of the 6154 titles and abstracts screened, 34 studies that enrolled 3688 neonates were analyzed. Compared with routine care alone, plastic bag or wrap with a thermal mattress (mean difference [MD], 0.98 degreeC; 95% credible interval [CrI], 0.60-1.36 degreeC), plastic cap (MD, 0.83 degreeC; 95% CrI, 0.28-1.38 degreeC), plastic bag or wrap with heated humidified respiratory gas (MD, 0.76 degreeC; 95% CrI, 0.38-1.15 degreeC), plastic bag or wrap with a plastic cap (MD, 0.62 degreeC; 95% CrI, 0.37-0.88 degreeC), thermal mattress (MD, 0.62 degreeC; 95% CrI, 0.33-0.93 degreeC), and plastic bag or wrap (MD, 0.56 degreeC; 95% CrI, 0.44-0.69 degreeC) were associated with greater core body temperature. Certainty of evidence was moderate for 5 interventions and low for plastic bag or wrap with a thermal mattress. When compared with routine care alone, a plastic bag or wrap with heated humidified respiratory gas was associated with less risk of major brain injury (risk ratio, 0.23; 95% CrI, 0.03-0.67; moderate certainty of evidence) and a plastic bag or wrap with a plastic cap was associated with decreased risk of mortality (risk ratio, 0.19; 95% CrI, 0.02-0.66; low certainty of evidence).

   Conclusions and Relevance: Results of this study indicate that most thermal care interventions in the delivery room for preterm neonates were associated with improved core body temperature (with moderate certainty of evidence). Specifically, use of a plastic bag or wrap with a plastic cap or with heated humidified gas was associated with lower risk of major brain injury and mortality (with low to moderate certainty of evidence).

Title
  Parent-infant skin-to-skin contact reduces the electrical activity of the diaphragm and stabilizes respiratory function in preterm infants.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The physiological benefit of parent-infant skin-to-skin contact (SSC) is uncertain for preterm infants with ventilatory support. We aimed to investigate whether SSC stabilizes the respiration compared to incubator care in mechanically ventilated preterm infants.

   METHODS: The prospective observational study was performed in Turku University Hospital, Finland. Preterm infants were eligible if they were born before 36 weeks gestation and received respiratory support with either invasive or non-invasive neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA). SSC was applied as soon as possible after birth. Respiratory variables were collected from the ventilator log data, and SSC episodes were compared with matched control periods during incubator care.

   RESULTS: A total of 167 episodes of SSC were recorded from 17 preterm infants: 138 episodes during invasive NAVA and 29 episodes during non-invasive NAVA. During invasive NAVA, peak electrical activity of the diaphragm (Edi), minimum Edi, respiratory rate, time on backup ventilation, peak inspiratory pressure, and mean airway pressure were significantly lower in SSC than in incubator care. During non-invasive NAVA, peak Edi, minimum Edi, time on backup ventilation, and peak inspiratory pressure were significantly lower in SSC than in incubator care.

   CONCLUSIONS: SSC stabilized and improved the respiratory physiology in mechanically ventilated preterm infants.

   IMPACT: Skin-to-skin contact reduced work of breathing compared to incubator care in mechanically ventilated preterm infants. Skin-to-skin contact reduced the need for backup ventilation during neurally adjusted ventilatory assist in preterm infants. Skin-to-skin contact among ventilated preterm infants was not only safe but also stabilized and improved their respiratory physiology.

Title
  A Systematic Review of the Effects of Skin-to-Skin Contact on Biomarkers of Stress in Preterm Infants and Parents.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Premature infants and their parents experience significant stress related to separation and lifesaving procedures. While evidence suggests that skin-to-skin contact (SSC) is a stress-reducing intervention for both neonates and parents, the mechanisms that underlie its efficacy are not well understood.

   OBJECTIVE: Purpose of this systematic review is to summarize the current state of knowledge on changes in biomarkers (ie, oxytocin [OT], cortisol, hypoxanthine, xanthine, uric acid, and allantoin), associated with SSC in premature infants and parents, that may reflect physiologic responses to stress.

   METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted from 1990 to 2020. Studies were selected using prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria.

   RESULTS: Of the 175 studies identified, only 19 are included in this review. Ten studies evaluated only infants, 2 evaluated only parents, and 7 evaluated for changes in biomarkers in both infants and parents. Cortisol was the most common biomarker evaluated. While changes in infants' cortisol levels were highly variable, in 55% of the parent studies, parent cortisol levels decreased following SSC. In both parents and infants, OT levels decreased following SSC. Only 1 study found that allantoin levels were significantly lower in infants who received SSC.

   IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND RESEARCH: While evidence suggests the numerous benefits of SSC, additional research is needed to identify the optimal biomarker to determine the mechanisms that underlie these effects. The use of novel biomarkers (eg, gene expression changes microbiome) may provide new insights into the mechanisms that underlie the efficacy of SSC.Video Abstract available at:https://journals.lww.com/advancesinneonatalcare/Pages/videogallery.aspx.

Title
  The Effect of Paternal Skin-to-Skin Care: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Control Trials.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Research about skin-to-skin care (SSC) experiences in early period after birth has focused on mothers and infants.

   PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the outcomes of paternal skin-to-skin care (P-SSC) in both fathers and infants.

   METHODS: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Airiti Library, and Google Scholar were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that reported outcomes of P-SSC in both fathers and infants. We calculated pooled mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using RevMan 5.3 for the meta-analysis [PROSPERO: CRD42018106790].

   RESULTS: Seven RCTs including a total of 552 participants were eligible for inclusion. Compared to the maternal skin-to-skin care (M-SSC), fathers in the P-SSC exhibited no significant differences in salivary oxytocin levels (MD: -0.35 pg/mL; 95% CI: -0.75, 0.05), salivary cortisol levels (MD: 0.25 mug/dL; 95% CI: -0.82, 1.33), or anxiety scores (MD: -0.17; 95% CI: -0.57, 0.22) during the period of SSC. Similarly, there were no significant differences in the salivary cortisol levels (MD: -0.11 mug/dL; 95% CI: -0.05, 0.28) among preterm infants between the 2 groups. However, the crying time was less among full-term infants in the P-SSC group compared with infants in the incubator care or cot care groups.

   IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND RESEARCH: P-SSC had similar effects as M-SSC on stress-related outcomes during and after SSC among fathers and infants in the early stages after birth. We recommend that P-SSC be implemented in the early stages after birth. Further RCTs with a longitudinal design and large samples are needed to better understand the long-term effects of P-SSC on fathers and infants.

Title
  [Prospective study on influence of perinatal factors on the development of early neonatal hypoglycemia in late-preterm and term infants]. [Spanish]
Abstract
  INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Neonatal hypoglycemia offers multiple controversies. The study aims to assess the main factors involved in the development of early hypoglycemia in term and late preterm infants, and the implication of different environmental circumstances.

   METHODS: A prospective cohort study, in infants born between 34 0/7 weeks and 36 6/7 weeks of gestation. Three capillary blood glucose determinations were performed during the eight first hours after birth.

   SAMPLE SIZE: 207; 59 neonates developed hypoglycemia.

   RESULTS: Prenatal risk factors include gestational diabetes with poor glycemic control, twin pregnancy and gestational age. The presence of meconium amniotic fluid and planned cesarean delivery are associated with a higher probability of hypoglycemia. After birth, skin to skin contact, breastfeeding, soft lightening, and normothermia are described as protective factors. The predictive model that combines the type of lightening, body temperature and the excess of bases level, correctly classifies 98% of the severe hypoglycemia cases, with a high Nagelkerke R2 value (0.645) and specificity of 99.5%.

   CONCLUSIONS: Postnatal environmental factors seem to be directly related to early hypoglycemia development, so it is essential to support the maternal-child union and breastfeeding. Our results allow better identification of neonates who are not subsidiary to performing blood glucose determinations because they have little risk of developing it. Copyright © 2021.

Title
  When can I hold my baby? An audit of time to first cuddle for preterm babies (<32 weeks) pre introduction and post introduction of a Family-Integrated Care model.
Abstract
  AIM: The audit examined time to first cuddle between preterm babies (born < 32 weeks) and their parent pre- and post-introduction of a family-integrated care model. Secondary outcomes included time to full feeds and length of neonatal intensive care stay.

   BACKGROUND: Parental separation due to neonatal intensive care unit admission is known to negatively affect parental and baby wellbeing.

   DESIGN: A "before-after" design compared outcomes for babies admitted pre- (2015) and post (2018)-implementation of the model in a Western Australian neonatal intensive care unit.

   METHODS: A retrospective medical record audit included babies from two gestational age groups in 2015 and 2018, born <=27 + 6 weeks and 28-31 + 6 weeks. SQUIRE checklist guided reporting of the audit.

   RESULTS: One hundred fifty-three babies were included in the audit, 79 from 2015 (<=27 + 6 weeks n = 39 and 28-31 + 6 weeks n = 40) and 74 from 2018 (<=27 + 6 weeks n = 35 and 28-31 + 6 weeks n = 39). Babies in both years were born at similar median gestational ages with comparable birthweights. Babies born <=27 + 6 weeks in 2018 were cuddled earlier (median = 141 h old) compared with those in 2015 (median = 157 h old). Median time to reach full feeds decreased and was significant in the <=27 + 6-week group: 288 h (12 days) in 2015 to 207.5 h (8.6 days) in 2018. Length of stay was longer for the <=27 + 6-week gestation 2018 group (median = 64 days) and 28-31 + 6-week gestation 2018 group (median = 22 days).

   CONCLUSION: Family-integrated care models may decrease the time to first cuddle and full feeds. Further research on outcomes such as breastfeeding, infant weight gain and length of stay can extend existing knowledge.

   RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Family-integrated care models may offer benefits to families of hospitalised preterm babies and investigating barriers to its implementation and creation of solutions to overcome barriers warrants attention. Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Title
  The newborn infant parasympathetic evaluation in pediatric and neonatology: a literature review. [Review]
Abstract
  PURPOSE: The Newborn Infant Parasympathetic Evaluation (NIPE) is a heart rate variability-based technology for assessing pain and comfort in neonates and infants under 2-years-old. This review aims to investigate the clinical utility of the NIPE.

   METHODS: Two investigators screened Pubmed/Medline and Google Scholar for relevant studies, independently. One investigator extracted data, which were reviewed by a second investigator.

   RESULTS: The NIPE was used during/after painful stimuli (6 studies), in the context of general anaesthesia (2 studies), and for comfort assessment (6 studies). A) Evaluation of procedural pain/distress: 2 studies reported that the mean-NIPE could be used for reliable monitoring of prolonged pain, and one study reported the association between instant-NIPE and pain after a stimulus but the instant-NIPE represents the NIPE average over 3 min. Two studies found no correlation between the NIPE and comfort behavior/pain scales, but they mainly differed in patients' gestational age and evaluation methodology. B) There are only 2 studies for the evaluation of nociception during surgery under general anaesthesia with contradictory results. C) Studies assessing neonates' comfort reported increased NIPE scores during skin-to-skin contact and during facilitated tucking associated with a human voice. No effect on NIPE scores of facilitated tucking during echocardiography was reported in preterm infants. One study reported significantly different NIPE scores with 2 surfactant therapy protocols. Overall, study populations were small and heterogeneous.

   CONCLUSION: The results regarding NIPE's performances differ between studies. Given the limited number of studies and the heterogeneous outcomes, more studies are required to confirm the NIPE usefulness in the different clinical settings.

Title
  Cerebral oxygenation in preterm infants during maternal singing combined with skin-to-skin care.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Our aim was to investigate the effect of music therapy in combination with skin-to-skin care (SSC) on regional cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) measured with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in premature infants and to study physiological stability during the interventions.

   METHODS: This was a prospective single-center observational cohort study conducted in a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit. The study consisted of four phases: (1) baseline measurements in an incubator for 30 min; (2) quiet SSC for 30 min (SSC-Pre); (3) SSC with live maternal singing accompanied by live guitar music for 20 min (SSC-Music); (4) final quiet SSC for another 30 min (SSC-Post).

   RESULTS: The primary outcome measure of mean rSO2 for the 31 preterm infants analyzed showed a significant increase from baseline during SSC-Music (76.87% vs 77.74%, p = 0.04) and SSC-Post (76.87% vs 78.0%, p = 0.03) phases. There were no significant changes observed in heart rate (HR), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), and cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction (cFTOE). The coefficient of variation (CV) of rSO2 and SpO2 decreased during each intervention phase.

   CONCLUSION: Combining music therapy with SSC appears to be safe in preterm neonates. The impact of the small increase in rSO2 and reduced variability of SpO2 and rSO2 warrants further investigation.

   IMPACT: Music therapy combined with skin-to-skin care (SSC) is safe in clinically stable premature infants and could be encouraged as part of developmental care. This is the first report where near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to detect the simultaneous effect of music therapy and SSC on cerebral rSO2 in preterm infants. Music therapy with SSC caused a modest increase in rSO2 and decreased the coefficient of variation of rSO2 and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), which suggest short-term benefits for preterm infants.

Title
  Determinants of neonatal hypothermia among neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care unit northwest, Ethiopia, case-control study.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Neonatal mortality is a global public health problem disproportionally high in developing country including Ethiopia. Hypothermia plays a significant role in neonatal mortality. This study was conducted to identify determinants of neonatal hypothermia among neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of public hospitals.

   METHODS AND MATERIALS: Institutional based unmatched case-control study was conducted in Bahir Dar town public hospitals among neonates admitted in the NICUs in 2019. A total of 387 participants were included in the study. Pretested, structured questionnaire, and data extraction checklist were used to collect results. Data analysis was done by using Stata version 14 .

   RESULTS: Low birth weight (adjusted odd ratio (AOR)=3.01, 95%CI: 1.50-5.58), nighttime delivery (AOR = 1.90, 95%CI: 1.13-3.13), lack skin to skin contact (AOR = 2.43, 95%CI: 1.42-4.16), delayed initiation of breast feeding (AOR = 2.24, 95%CI: 1.30-3.88), not wearing cape (AOR = 1.87, 95%CI: 1.07-3.26), and low Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration (APGAR) score (AOR = 2.17, 95%CI: 1.15-4.10) were determinant variables of the neonatal hypothermia.

   CONCLUSIONS: Skin to skin contact, initiation of breast feeding, birth weight, time, low APGAR score, and not wearing cape were identified as independent determinates of neonatal hypothermia.

Title
  Demographic, Social, and Personal Factors Associated with Lactation Cessation by 6 Weeks in Mothers of Very Low Birth Weight Infants.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Although mother's own milk decreases prematurity-associated morbidities, mothers of infants born preterm and very low birth weight experience a significantly shorter lactation duration. Little is known regarding factors associated with lactation cessation during the hospitalization of a very low birth weight infant.

   RESEARCH AIM: To determine demographic, social, and personal factors associated with lactation cessation by 6-weeks postpartum in mothers delivering very low birth weight infants.

   METHODS: We used a retrospective, longitudinal, two-group comparison design using data from a randomized control study. Mothers of very low birth weight infants (N = 142) were enrolled from a labor and delivery unit associated with a Level 4 neonatal intensive care unit. Demographic, social, and health information was obtained from the medical records. Participants were surveyed regarding lactation goals, experience, and reason(s) for cessation.

   RESULTS: Participants who did not continue lactating for more than 6 weeks were more likely to be unemployed (p = .019), Medicaid eligible (p = .009), less educated (p < .031), smoke (p = .002), provide less skin-to-skin care (p = .007), and to delay the decision to provide their milk to their infant (p = .007). After Bonferroni adjustment, only minutes of skin-to-skin care remained statistically significant. Insufficient maternal milk production was the most common reason for lactation cessation.

   CONCLUSION: While the etiology of lactation cessation is often non-modifiable, strategies aimed at maintaining mother's own milk production, smoking cessation, increasing skin-to-skin care, and promoting an earlier decision to lactate, may prolong lactation duration in this vulnerable population. This RCT was registered (2012-00071) with ClinicalTrials.com on 6/28/2013.

Title
  Predisposing factors for excessive loss of weight in exclusively breastfed term and late preterm neonates - a case control study.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Exclusively breastfed healthy neonates can lose weight excessively due to poor milk production, inadequate enteral intake or due to poor milk transfer. The studies assessing risk factors for infants to lose weight excessively are diverse and results are highly varied.

   OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the risk factors for weight loss of over 10% in term and late preterm newborns who were exclusively breastfed.

   METHODS: This was a case-control study which was conducted in a tertiary care hospital. Exclusively breastfed neonates of >=34 weeks having weight loss of >10% in the first 14 days of life comprised the study group with gestational age and weight-matched neonates without significant weight loss forming the control group. Demographic details, LATCH score, maternal EPDS (Edinburg postpartum depression score) and neonatal morbidities were assessed.

   RESULTS: Of the 53 mother-infant dyad in each group, baseline characteristics were similar. Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM), Lower segment Caesarean section (LSCS) delivery, higher EPDS score, low LATCH score, absence of immediate skin to skin contact were associated with excessive weight loss and was found to be significant statistically. Babies in the study group had higher incidence of jaundice and hypernatremia and had longer duration of stay in hospital.

   CONCLUSION: Lack of early skin to skin contact, higher EPDS scores and lower LATCH scores are predisposing factors for exclusively breastfed infants to lose weight excessively.

Title
  Family Rooms in Neonatal Intensive Care Units and Neonatal Outcomes: An International Survey and Linked Cohort Study.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the proportion of neonatal intensive care units with facilities supporting parental presence in their infants' rooms throughout the 24-hour day (ie, infant-parent rooms) in high-income countries and to analyze the association of this with outcomes of extremely preterm infants.

   STUDY DESIGN: In this survey and linked cohort study, we analyzed unit design and facilities for parents in 10 neonatal networks of 11 countries. We compared the composite outcome of mortality or major morbidity, length of stay, and individual morbidities between neonates admitted to units with and without infant-parent rooms by linking survey responses to patient data from 2015 for neonates of less than 29 weeks of gestation.

   RESULTS: Of 331 units, 13.3% (44/331) provided infant-parent rooms. Patient-level data were available for 4662 infants admitted to 159 units in 7 networks; 28% of the infants were cared for in units with infant-parent rooms. Neonates from units with infant-parent rooms had lower odds of mortality or major morbidity (aOR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.64-0.89), including lower odds of sepsis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, than those from units without infant-parent rooms. The adjusted mean length of stay was 3.4 days shorter (95%, CI -4.7 to -3.1) in the units with infant-parent rooms.

   CONCLUSIONS: The majority of units in high-income countries lack facilities to support parents' presence in their infants' rooms 24 hours per day. The availability vs absence of infant-parent rooms was associated with lower odds of composite outcome of mortality or major morbidity and a shorter length of stay. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Title
  Systematic review confirmed the benefits of early skin-to-skin contact but highlighted lack of studies on very and extremely preterm infants. [Review]
Abstract
  AIM: We systematically reviewed the literature to identify the benefits of early skin-to-skin contact (SSC) for all gestational ages.

   METHODS: The MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases were searched for papers published in English from 1 January 1975 to 31 March 2020. Early SSC was defined as when the infant was placed directly onto the mother's chest within 180 min of birth. Two authors independently searched the databases, appraised study quality and extracted the study design and outcome data. The primary outcomes were the infants' physiological stability after birth: thermoregulation and stabilisation. The secondary outcomes were exclusive breastfeeding and mother-infant interaction.

   RESULTS: We reviewed 30 studies that assessed the benefits of early SSC: 22 comprised term-born healthy infants and eight focused on preterm or ill infants. These included various gestational ages, birth methods and cultural backgrounds. The studies demonstrated that early SSC stabilised neonatal physiological parameters, promoted exclusive breastfeeding and supported bonding. Most of the data were from term and late preterm births.

   CONCLUSION: This systematic review showed that early SSC could be beneficial. Further studies that focus on providing very and extremely preterm infants with SSC, and parental experiences, are needed to enable SSC to be adopted as routine practice.

Title
  Neonatal Golden Hour: A survey of Australian and New Zealand Neonatal Network units' early stabilisation practices for very preterm infants.
Abstract
  AIM: To identify current 'Golden Hour' practices for initial stabilisation of very preterm infants <32 weeks' gestational age (GA) within tertiary neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in the Australian and New Zealand Neonatal Network (ANZNN).

   METHODS: A 76-question survey regarding delivery room (DR) and NICU stabilisation practices was distributed electronically to directors of tertiary perinatal NICUs in the ANZNN in January 2019. Responses were categorised into GA subgroups: 23-24, 25-27 and 28-31 weeks' GA.

   RESULTS: The response rate was 100% (24/24 units). Delayed cord clamping (DCC) was practised 'always' or 'often' by 21 units (88%). All units used oximetry to target oxygen saturations, and 23/24 (96%) commenced resuscitation in <40% oxygen. Ten units (42%) routinely used DR electrocardiography monitoring. CPAP was preferred as primary respiratory support in one-third of units for infants born 23-24 weeks' GA, compared with 19 units (79%) at 25-27 weeks' GA and 23 units (96%) at 28-31 weeks' GA. DR skin-to-skin care was uncommon, particularly at lower GAs. Five units (21%) used minimally invasive surfactant therapy for non-intubated infants at 23-24 weeks' GA, 13 units (54%) at 25-27 weeks' GA and 16 units (67%) at 28-31 weeks' GA.

   CONCLUSIONS: Most Golden Hour stabilisation practices align with international guidelines. Consistency exists with respect to DCC, oxygen saturation targeting and primary CPAP use for infants 25 weeks' GA and above. Where evidence is less certain, practices vary across ANZNN NICUs. Time targets for stabilisation measures may help standardise practice for this population. Copyright © 2021 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians).

Title
  Development and validation of a predictive model of exclusive breastfeeding at hospital discharge: Retrospective cohort study.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The benefits of breastfeeding for both mother and newborn have been widely demonstrated. However, breastfeeding rates at discharge are lower than recommended, so being able to identify women at risk of not breastfeeding at discharge could allow professionals to prioritise care.

   OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a predictive model of exclusive breastfeeding at hospital discharge.

   DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study on women who gave birth between 2014 and 2019 in Spain.

   DATA SOURCES: The data source was a questionnaire distributed through the Spanish breastfeeding associations. The development of the predictive model was made on a cohort of 3387 women and was validated on a cohort of 1694 women. A multivariate analysis was performed by means of logistic regression, and predictive ability was determined by areas under the ROC curve (AUC).

   RESULTS: 80.2% (2717) women exclusively breastfed at discharge in the derivation cohort, and 82.1% (1390) in the validation cohort. The predictive factors in the final model were: maternal age at birth; BMI; number of children; previous breastfeeding; birth plan; induced birth; epidural analgesia; type of birth; prematurity; multiple pregnancy; macrosomia; onset of breastfeeding within the first hour; and skin-to-skin contact. The predictive ability (ROC AUC) in the derivation cohort was 0.76 (CI 95%: 0.74-0.78), while in the validation cohort it was 0.74 (CI 95%: 0.71-0.77).

   CONCLUSIONS: A predictive model of exclusive maternal breastfeeding at hospital discharge has been developed, based on thirteen variables, with satisfactory predictive ability in both the derivation cohort and the validation cohort according to the Swets' criteria. This model can identify women who are at high risk of not breastfeeding at hospital discharge. Copyright © 2021. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Title
  Effects of skin-to-skin care on electrical activity of the diaphragm in preterm infants during neurally adjusted ventilatory assist.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Skin-to-skin care (SSC) reduces neonatal mortality and morbidity and is widely implemented in the neonatal intensive care unit. However, changes in respiratory effort during SSC in ventilated preterm infants remain unclear.

   AIMS: To evaluate the effect of SSC on electrical activity of the diaphragm (Edi) and vital signs in premature infants who are intubated and under neurally adjusted ventilatory assist ventilation.

   STUDY DESIGN: We performed an observational cross-over study. Data were measured in three periods: before (pre-SSC period), during (SSC period), and after (post-SSC period) SSC. Stable 30-min data in each period were extracted.

   SUBJECTS: Thirty-four SSC procedures were performed in 14 preterm infants with a median gestational age of 25.3 weeks (interquartile range, 24, 26.4) and a birth weight of 659 g (566, 694). The median postnatal age was 41 days (31, 53) at the study with a median postmenstrual age of 31.3 weeks (30.4, 32.5).

   OUTCOME MEASURES: Median values of Edi peak, Edi minimum, respiratory rate, SpO2, and heart rate were measured in each condition. The Kruskal-Wallis test with Bonferroni multiple comparisons was used to compare each parameter in each period.

   RESULTS: Median Edi peak and Edi minimum values were significantly lower during SSC compared with pre- and post-SSC, without any change in respiratory rate, SpO2, or heart rate.

   CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory efforts as evaluated by Edi are significantly reduced during SSC in ventilated preterm infants. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title
  Project20: Does continuity of care and community-based antenatal care improve maternal and neonatal birth outcomes for women with social risk factors? A prospective, observational study.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Social factors associated with poor childbirth outcomes and experiences of maternity care include minority ethnicity, poverty, young motherhood, homelessness, difficulty speaking or understanding English, migrant or refugee status, domestic violence, mental illness and substance abuse. It is not known what specific aspects of maternity care work to improve the maternal and neonatal outcomes for these under-served, complex populations.

   METHODS: This study aimed to compare maternal and neonatal clinical birth outcomes for women with social risk factors accessing different models of maternity care. Quantitative data on pregnancy and birth outcome measures for 1000 women accessing standard care, group practice and specialist models of care at two large, inner-city maternity services were prospectively collected and analysed using multinominal regression. The level of continuity of care and place of antenatal care were used as independent variables to explore these potentially influential aspects of care. Outcomes adjusted for women's social and medical risk factors and the service attended.

   RESULTS: Women who received standard maternity care were significantly less likely to use water for pain relief in labour (RR 0.11, CI 0.02-0.62) and have skin to skin contact with their baby shortly after birth (RR 0.34, CI 0.14-0.80) compared to the specialist model of care. Antenatal care based in the hospital setting was associated with a significant increase in preterm birth (RR 2.38, CI 1.32-4.27) and low birth weight (RR 2.31, CI 1.24-4.32), and a decrease in induction of labour (RR 0.65, CI 0.45-0.95) compared to community-based antenatal care, this was despite women's medical risk factors. A subgroup analysis found that preterm birth was increased further for women with the highest level of social risk accessing hospital-based antenatal care (RR 3.11, CI1.49-6.50), demonstrating the protective nature of community-based antenatal care.

   CONCLUSIONS: This research highlights how community-based antenatal care, with a focus on continuity of carer reduced health inequalities and improved maternal and neonatal clinical outcomes for women with social risk factors. The findings support the current policy drive to increase continuity of midwife-led care, whilst adding that community-based care may further improve outcomes for women at increased risk of health inequalities. The relationship between community-based models of care and neonatal outcomes require further testing in future research. The identification of specific mechanisms such as help-seeking and reduced anxiety, to explain these findings are explored in a wider evaluation.

Title
  Barriers and Facilitators to Breastfeeding in Moderate and Late Preterm Infants: A Systematic Review.
Abstract
  Rationale: Most of the preterm infants are born between 32 and 36 weeks of gestation (moderate to late preterm infants [MLPIs]). This comes with significant short- and long-term risks. Breastfeeding reduces many of these risks, but breastfeeding rates in MLPIs are lower than those in full-term infants. We performed a systematic review of studies identifying factors associated with successful breastfeeding in MLPIs and interventions to improve breastfeeding. Methods: Systematic search performed using PubMed April 24, 2020. In total, 11 articles describing barriers to breastfeeding in MLPIs and 6 articles about interventions to improve breastfeeding were included. Interventions were categorized according to different outcomes: breastfeeding initiation, continuation for 5 days to 6 weeks, and continuation >=3 months. Because of heterogeneity in study characteristics, no meta-analysis was performed. Results: Breastfeeding rates were lower in those with lower socioeconomic status and single-parent households. Providing parents with more information and direct health care support significantly improved breastfeeding initiation. Cup feeding instead of bottle feeding had inconsistent effects on breastfeeding initiation and continuation. Continuous skin-to-skin contact did not affect breastfeeding initiation or continuation. Discussion: Risk groups for lower breastfeeding rates of MLPIs include mothers with lower socioeconomic status and single mothers. Interventions that may improve breastfeeding include cup feeding and providing parents with more information and health care support. Key limitations of included studies are lack of adequate adjustment for confounders and lack of blinding. However, this is the first systematic review identifying both risk groups and interventions to improve breastfeeding in MLPIs.

Title
  A pilot study demonstrating the impact of the supporting and enhancing NICU sensory experiences (SENSE) program on the mother and infant.
Abstract
  AIM: To explore differences in maternal mental health and infant neurobehavioral outcome among infants who received and did not receive the Supporting and Enhancing NICU Sensory Experiences (SENSE) program.

   STUDY DESIGN: Eighty preterm infants (50 receiving standard-of-care and 30 receiving the SENSE program) born <=32 weeks gestation were enrolled within the first week of life in a prospective quasi-experimental design, using a historical control group for comparison. Standard-of-care consisted of tactile (skin-to-skin, touch, holding) and olfactory (scent cloth, close maternal contact) interventions as determined to be appropriate by health care professionals and parents. The SENSE group received specific doses of tactile (skin-to-skin care, holding, massage, touch), auditory (human speech, music), olfactory (scent cloth, close maternal contact), kinesthetic/vestibular (movement, rocking/transfers), and visual (dim or cycled light) exposures, based on the infant's postmenstrual age and tailored to medical status and infant cues according to the SENSE program. The SENSE program includes the intentional delivery of positive, age-appropriate sensory exposures by parents (or a sensory support team, when parents are unavailable) each day of NICU hospitalization. Infant neurobehavioral outcome, as well as maternal mental health and confidence, were assessed prior to NICU discharge, using standardized measures.

   RESULTS: Seventy-three infants were included in the final analysis. Mothers whose infants received the SENSE program demonstrated higher scores on the Maternal Confidence Questionnaire (p = 0.01). Infants who received the SENSE program demonstrated less asymmetry on the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (p = 0.02; mean difference 0.9) and higher scores on the Hammersmith Neonatal Neurological Evaluation (p < 0.001; mean difference 4.8).

   DISCUSSION: Preliminary evidence demonstrates improvements in maternal confidence and infant neurobehavioral performance following SENSE implementation. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title
  First Brazilian recommendation on physiotherapy with sensory motor stimulation in newborns and infants in the intensive care unit. [Portuguese, English]
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To present guidelines on sensory motor stimulation for newborns and infants in the intensive care unit.

   METHODS: We employed a mixed methods design with a systematic review of the literature and recommendations based on scientific evidence and the opinions of physiotherapists with neonatal expertise. The research included studies published between 2010 and 2018 in the MEDLINE R and Cochrane databases that included newborns (preterm and term) and infants (between 28 days and 6 months of age) hospitalized in the intensive care unit and submitted to sensory motor stimulation methods. The studies found were classified according to the GRADE score by five physiotherapists in different regions of Brazil and presented at eight Scientific Congresses held to discuss the clinical practice guidelines.

   RESULTS: We included 89 articles to construct the clinical practice guidelines. Auditory, gustatory and skin-to-skin stimulation stand out for enhancing vital signs, and tactile-kinesthetic massage and multisensory stimulation stand out for improving weight or sucking.

   CONCLUSION: Although all modalities have good ratings for pain or stress control, it is recommended that sensory motor stimulation procedures be tailored to the infant's specific needs and that interventions and be carried out by expert professionals.

Title
  Synchronous caregiving from birth to adulthood tunes humans' social brain.
Abstract
  Mammalian young are born with immature brain and rely on the mother's body and caregiving behavior for maturation of neurobiological systems that sustain adult sociality. While research in animal models indicated the long-term effects of maternal contact and caregiving on the adult brain, little is known about the effects of maternal-newborn contact and parenting behavior on social brain functioning in human adults. We followed human neonates, including premature infants who initially lacked or received maternal-newborn skin-to-skin contact and full-term controls, from birth to adulthood, repeatedly observing mother-child social synchrony at key developmental nodes. We tested the brain basis of affect-specific empathy in young adulthood and utilized multivariate techniques to distinguish brain regions sensitive to others' distinct emotions from those globally activated by the empathy task. The amygdala, insula, temporal pole (TP), and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) showed high sensitivity to others' distinct emotions. Provision of maternal-newborn contact enhanced social synchrony across development from infancy and up until adulthood. The experience of synchrony, in turn, predicted the brain's sensitivity to emotion-specific empathy in the amygdala and insula, core structures of the social brain. Social synchrony linked with greater empathic understanding in adolescence, which was longitudinally associated with higher neural sensitivity to emotion-specific empathy in TP and VMPFC. Findings demonstrate the centrality of synchronous caregiving, by which infants practice the detection and sharing of others' affective states, for tuning the human social brain, particularly in regions implicated in salience detection, interoception, and mentalization that underpin affect sharing and human attachment.

Title
  Implementing a Skin-to-Skin Care and Parent Touch Initiative in a Tertiary Cardiac and Surgical Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Skin-to-skin care (SSC) has been integrated as an essential component of developmental care for preterm infants. Despite documented benefits, SSC is not routinely practiced in the cardiac and surgical neonatal intensive care unit, with a predominantly term population, due to staff apprehension, patient factors and acuity, and environmental constraints.

   PURPOSE: The purpose of this quality improvement project was to increase SSC, parental holds, and parent touch events for infants in our cardiac and surgical neonatal intensive care unit. When traditional SSC was not possible, alternative holds and alternative parent touch (APT) methods were encouraged.

   METHODS: Quality improvement and qualitative descriptive methodology were utilized to assess baseline, develop education and practice changes, and evaluate the use of SSC, holds, and APT methods at 12 and 18 months postintervention. Implementation included educational tools and resource development, simulations, peer champions, in-class teaching, and team huddles. Decisions around the type of hold and parent touch were fluid and reflected complex infant, family, staff, and physical space needs.

   FINDINGS: Given its initial scarcity, there was an increased frequency of SSC and variety of holds or APT events. Staff survey results indicated support for the practice and outlined persistent barriers.

   IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Skin-to-skin care, holds, and APT practices are feasible and safe for term and preterm infants receiving highly instrumented and complex cardiac and surgical care.

   IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Future research regarding the intervention's impact on neurodevelopmental outcomes of infants and on parent resilience in the surgical and cardiac neonatal intensive care unit is warranted. Copyright © 2020 by the National Association of Neonatal Nurses.

Title
  Safety of immediate skin-to-skin contact after vaginal birth in vigorous late preterm neonates - A pilot study.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: To evaluate the safety of immediate skin-to-skin contact (SSC) in vigorous late preterm neonates, where observation under radiant warmer is standard of care, in a prospective, randomized, controlled, and equivalence pilot study.

   METHODS: Singletons born vaginally at 35-36 6/7 weeks gestation were randomized to initiate immediate SSC or standard of care with continuous pulse oximeter monitoring for the first hour of life.

   RESULTS: Forty-seven dyads were randomized to SSC (n = 21) or radiant warmer (n = 26). Vitals were recorded at designated time intervals to assess tolerance of postnatal transitioning. We found no significant difference in the number of SSC interruptions, pulse oximeter readings, initial glucose level, and rates of hypoglycemia, hypothermia, or NICU admission between the two groups.

   CONCLUSIONS: Vigorous late preterm neonates transitioned to immediate SSC without additional risks compared to control counterparts. Large, multicenter, and randomized-control studies need to be conducted to establish standardized guidelines for this practice.

Title
  Developing the Preterm Breastfeeding Attitudes Instrument: A tool for describing attitudes to breastfeeding among health care professionals in neonatal intensive care.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop an instrument that measures health care professionals' (HCPs) attitudes to breastfeeding and skin-to-skin contact in relation to the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative for neonatal intensive care.

   DESIGN: The study was part of a larger project aiming to revive the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding for both full-term and preterm infants. The study had a pre-test/post-test design using online questionnaires distributed by email before and after a training programme.

   SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 70 specialist registered nurses, registered nurses, assistant nurses and physicians working at a Swedish neonatal intensive care unit answered 55 breastfeeding attitudes questions online before the training. The Preterm Breastfeeding Attitudes Instrument (PreBAI) consists of twelve of these 55 items/questions, selected using exploratory factor analysis.

   MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS: Higher scores indicated more positive attitudes and the median total PreBAI score was 42 points (out of 48), on both the pre- and the post-test questionnaires, showing no significant difference. In the pre-test questionnaire, the majority of HCPs (84%) stated that they needed further breastfeeding training. They also stated that they perceived breastfeeding as very important, scoring a median of 10 (range 5-10) points on a 10-point scale. Three separate underlying dimensions were identified in the questionnaire, indicating different attitudes: Facilitating (five items), Regulating (four items), and Breastfeeding- and skin-to-skin contact-friendly (three items). A positive correlation was found between how many years the HCPs had worked in neonatal care, and their PreBAI score (rs = 0.383, p = 0.001). Those who had previously received extra breastfeeding education scored higher on the instrument.

   KEY CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Neonatal intensive care units need to increase their efforts to support breastfeeding. An important factor for mothers when establishing breastfeeding is support from well-trained professionals with a positive attitude to breastfeeding. The PreBAI could be a useful tool for identifying attitudes among HCPs before and after attending a breastfeeding training programme. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Title
  Blinded randomized crossover trial: Skin-to-skin care vs. sucrose for preterm neonatal pain.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To compare skin-to-skin care (SSC) and oral sucrose for preterm neonatal pain control.

   METHODS: Preterm neonates (28-36 weeks gestation) requiring heel-stick were eligible. In group-A, SSC was given 15-min before first heel-stick, and sucrose was given 2-min before second heel-stick. In group-B, the sequence was reversed. Blinded premature infant pain profile (PIPP) score assessment was done at 0, 1, and 5-min of heel-stick by two assessors.

   RESULTS: A hundred neonates were enrolled. The inter-rater agreement for the PIPP score was good. The behavior state component was significantly lower in the sucrose group at all assessment points. The mean (SD) difference between 1-min and 0 min was similar [SSC 3.58(3.16) vs. sucrose 4.09(3.82), p = 0.24] between groups. The PIPP score attained baseline values at 5-min in both groups.

   CONCLUSION: Albeit sucrose indicated instantaneous action, SSC and sucrose have comparable clinical efficacy for preterm neonatal pain control. Multisensory stimulation with SSC may result in a higher behavioral state component of the PIPP score.

Title
  Cerebral hemodynamic response to a therapeutic bed for procedural pain management in preterm infants in the NICU: a randomized controlled trial.
Abstract
  Introduction: We developed a novel device, Calmer, that mimics key components of skin-to-skin holding to reduce stress in preterm infants. Our feasibility trial showed that Calmer worked 50% better than no treatment and no differently from our standard of care, facilitated tucking (FT), for reducing pain scores during a heel lance in preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit.

   Objective: We compared the effects of Calmer on regional cerebral hemodynamic activity during a noxious stimulation to FT.

   Methods: During a clinically required heel lance, we measured frontal cortex tissue oxygenation in a subsample of 29 preterm infants (27-33 weeks gestational age) from our larger randomized controlled trial. Infants were randomized to either FT (n = 16) or Calmer treatment (n = 12). The outcome measure, obtained using near-infrared spectroscopy, was a change in the tissue oxygenation index (TSI) across study phases (Baseline, Heel Lance, Recovery; median duration 517 seconds [421-906 seconds]).

   Results: No statistically significant differences were found between groups in the median TSI during any of the study phases. In response to the heel lance, 7 infants (27.6%) had a TSI that dipped below the 60% threshold (3 in the Calmer group 25% and 4 in the FT group 25%); none below 50%.

   Conclusions: Infants on Calmer maintained normal regional cerebral oxygen levels (55%-85%) no differently from infants receiving a human touch intervention during blood collection. Parental skin-to-skin holding is one of the most effective strategies to relieve procedural pain in preterm infants. When parents or FT are not available, Calmer shows potential for filling this gap in care. Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

Title
  Skin-to-Skin Care by Mother vs. Father for Preterm Neonatal Pain: A Randomized Control Trial (ENVIRON Trial).
Abstract
  Objective: To compare skin-to-skin care (SSC) given by mother and father for preterm neonatal pain control by premature infant pain profile (PIPP) score.

   Methods: 64 stable preterm (28-36 weeks gestational age) neonates born at a level-3 neonatal intensive care unit were included in the trial. Random allocation with the help of a computer-generated sequence was done. In group A, SSC was given by the mother 15 minutes before the first heel-stick, and subsequently, SSC was given by the father before the second heel-stick. In group B, the sequence of SSC provider was reversed. Blinded PIPP score assessment at 0, 1, and 5 minutes of heel-stick were done by two independent assessors using video recording.

   Results: The mean (SD) birth weight was 1665.18 (339.35) grams, and mean (SD) gestational age was 34.28 (2.24) weeks. The PIPP score at 0, 1, and 5 minutes had no statistical or clinically significant differences between both groups (PIPP score mean (SD) at 0 minute = 3.20 (1.11) vs. 3.01 (1.29), p value = 0.38; 1 minute = 8.59 (4.27) vs. 8.26 (4.08), p value = 0.66; 5 minutes = 3.79 (1.40) vs. 3.93 (1.99), p value = 0.65 in SSC by mother and father group, respectively). Furthermore, there was no statistical difference between the groups for any components of the PIPP score (all p values > 0.05). The PIPP score at 5 minutes almost attained the 0-minute level in both the groups.

   Conclusion: Father is as effective as the mother for providing skin-to-skin care for preterm neonatal pain control. This trial is registered with CTRI/2018/01/016783. Copyright © 2021 Vivek Vishwanath Shukla et al.

Title
  Neonatal Hypothermia and Associated Factors among Newborns Admitted in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Dessie Referral Hospital, Amhara Region, Northeast Ethiopia.
Abstract
  Introduction: Neonatal hypothermia is the reduction in the body temperature of the newborn (less than 36.5degreeC). It is a global problem in neonates born both at hospitals and homes, but it showed a higher prevalence in developing countries (>90%). Although hypothermia is rarely a direct cause of death, it contributes to a substantial proportion of neonatal mortality globally.

   Objective: To assess neonatal hypothermia and associated factors among newborns admitted in the NICU of Dessie Referral Hospital.

   Methods and Materials: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from March 15 to May 30, 2018. The data was collected from the mother and the chart of the newborn using a semistructured questionnaire. Data were cleaned, coded, and entered in EPI-info version 7.1.2.0 then exported to Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20 software for analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression and crude and adjusted odds ratio with their 95% confidence interval were computed. Finally, p value < 0.05 was used to identify variables that had a significant association with neonatal hypothermia.

   Result: The proportion of neonatal hypothermia in the study area was 66.8%. Preterm delivery (AOR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.1, 6.2), no skin-to-skin contact within 1 hour of delivery (AOR = 3.0, 95% CI: 1.3, 7.8), delivered at night time (AOR = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.02, 4.0), and neonates who had resuscitation (AOR = 2.9, 95% CI: 1.1, 7.2) showed significant association with neonatal hypothermia.

   Conclusion: In this study, the proportion of hypothermia was high. Preterm delivery, no skin-to-skin contact within 1 hour, night-time delivery, and having resuscitation were significantly associated with neonatal hypothermia. Therefore, special attention is needed for the thermal care of preterm neonates and neonates delivered at night time. Furthermore, there should be strict adherence to cost-effective thermal care recommendations like warm resuscitation and skin-to-skin contact. Copyright © 2020 Yibeltal Asmamaw Yitayew et al.

Title
  Prevalence and determinants of mother and newborn skin-to-skin contact in The Gambia: a secondary data analysis.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Skin-to-skin contact (SSC) between mother and the newborn brings many benefits including its potential to promote the survival of the newborn. Nevertheless, it is a practice that is underutilized in many resource-constrained settings including The Gambia where a high rate of maternal and child mortality has been reported. In this study, we examined the prevalence and determinants of mother and newborn SSC in The Gambia.

   METHODS: We used secondary data from The Gambia Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS)-2018. Data from 9205 women between 15-49 years who gave birth within 5 years of the survey was extracted for the analysis. Percentages and chi-square test were used for analyses. The significant variables from chi-square test were included in the multivariable binary logistic regression model to calculate the adjusted odds ratios (with corresponding 95% CI) of the factors associated with mother and newborn SSC.

   RESULTS: The results of this study showed that the national prevalence of mother and newborn SSC was 35.7%. Across local government areas; Mansakonko (47.8%) and Kerewan (44.2%) had the highest prevalence, while Basse (28.5%) and Brikama (26.5%) had the least prevalence of mother and newborn SSC in The Gambia. Based on results from the logit model, normal weight (at least 2.5 kg) children were 1.37 times as likely to have mother and newborn SSC, compared with the low birthweight (< 2.5 kg) children (OR = 1.37; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.78). In addition, there was 38% increase in the odds of rural women who reported mother and newborn SSC, compared with urban women (OR = 1.38; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.79). Women who delivered at health facility were 3.35 times as likely to have mother and newborn SSC, compared with women who delivered at home (OR = 3.35; 95% CI: 2.37, 4.75). Furthermore, women who initiated antenatal care (ANC) after the first trimester had 21% reduction in the odds of mother and newborn SSC, compared with women who initiated ANC within the first trimester (OR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.68, 0.93).

   CONCLUSION: The prevalence of mother and newborn SSC was low. In addition, geographical residence, birth weight, urban-rural residential status, place of delivery, and timing to ANC initiation were associated with mother and newborn SSC. There is a need to promote institutional based delivery using skilled birth attendance, promote early ANC initiation and healthy fetal growth.

Title
  Interactive Guidance Intervention to Address Sustained Social Withdrawal in Preterm Infants in Chile: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Preterm newborns can be exposed early to significant perinatal stress, and this stress can increase the risk of altered socioemotional development. Sustained social withdrawal in infants is an early indicator of emotional distress which is expressed by low reactivity to the environment, and if persistent, is frequently associated with altered psychological development. Infants born prematurely have a higher probability of developing sustained social withdrawal (adjusted odds ratio 1.84, 95% CI 1.04-3.26) than infants born full term, and there is a correlation between weight at birth and sustained social withdrawal at 12 months of age.

   OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to compare the effect of the interactive guidance intervention to that of routine pediatric care on sustained social withdrawal in infants born moderately or late preterm and to explore the relationship between sustained social withdrawal in these infants and factors such as neonatal intensive care unit hospitalization variables, parental depression, and posttraumatic stress symptoms.

   METHODS: This study is designed as a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Moderate and late preterm newborns and their parents were recruited and randomized (1:1 allocation ratio) to control and experimental groups. During neonatal intensive care unit hospitalization, daily duration of skin-to-skin contact, breastfeeding, and parental visits were recorded. Also, a daily score for neonatal pain and painful invasive procedures were recorded. After discharge from neonatal intensive care, for the duration of the study, both groups will attend follow-up consultations with neonatologists at 2, 6, and 12 months of age (corrected for gestational age) and will receive routine pediatric care. Every consultation will be recorded and assessed with the Alarm Distress Baby Scale to detect sustained social withdrawal (indicated by a score of 5 or higher). The neonatologists will perform an interactive guidance intervention if an infant in the intervention group exhibits sustained social withdrawal. In each follow-up consultation, parents will fill out the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the modified Perinatal Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Questionnaire, and the Impact of Event Scale-revised.

   RESULTS: Recruitment for this trial started in September 2017. As of May 2020, we have completed enrollment (N=110 infants born moderately or late preterm). We aim to publish the results by mid-2021.

   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first randomized controlled trial with a sample of infants born moderately or late preterm infants who will attend pediatric follow-up consultations during their first year (corrected for gestational age at birth) with neonatologists trained in the Alarm Distress Baby Scale and who will receive this interactive guidance intervention. If successful, this early intervention will show significant potential to be implemented in both public and private health care, given its low cost of training staff and that the intervention takes place during routine pediatric follow-up.

  Hospitalising preterm infants in single family rooms versus open bay units: A systematic review and meta-analysis of impact on parents.
Abstract
  Background: Many parents develop stress-related symptoms and depression when their preterm infant is hospitalised in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) after birth. We reviewed the evidence of parent well-being with preterm infants hospitalised in single family rooms (SFRs) or in open bay neonatal units (OBUs).

   Methods: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science, Clinicaltrials.gov, and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) databases from inception through 22 November 2019 using controlled terms and text words related to prematurity and NICU-design. We included randomised and non-randomised studies comparing outcomes in parents with preterm infants admitted to SFRs or OBUs. Methodological quality was assessed using Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias Tool for randomised controlled trials and the Risk of Bias Tool for Non-Randomised Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I). Outcomes included: parental stress, satisfaction, participation (presence/involvement/skin-to-skin care), self-efficacy, parent-infant-bonding, depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, empowerment, and degree of family-centred care. Summary estimates were calculated using random effects models with standardised mean differences (SMDs). PROSPERO registration: CRD42016050643.

   Findings: We identified 614 unique publications. Eleven study populations (1, 850 preterm infants, 1, 549 mothers and 379 fathers) were included. All but one study were at serious to critical risk of bias. SFRs were associated with higher levels of parental presence, involvement, and skin-to-skin care. Upon discharge, SFRs were associated with lower stress levels (n=828 parents, SMD-0.30,95%CI -0.50;-0.09, p<0.004, I2=46%), specifically NICU-related stress (n=573, SMD-0.42,95%CI -0.61;-0.23, p<0.0001, I2=0%). In majority of studies higher levels of empowerment, family-centred care, and satisfaction was present with SFRs. No differences were found for anxiety, parent-infant bonding, or self-efficacy. Depression was high (up to 29%) but not different between settings. No studies described post-traumatic stress.

   Interpretation: Single family rooms seem to facilitate parental presence, involvement, skin-to-skin care, and reduce NICU-related parental stress. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

Title
  Improved exclusive breastfeeding rates in preterm infants after a neonatal nurse training program focusing on six breastfeeding-supportive clinical practices.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Early breast milk expression, prolonged skin-to-skin contact, rooming-in, use of test-weighing and minimizing use of pacifiers are positively associated with exclusive breastfeeding of preterm infants, whereas use of nipple shields is negatively associated.

   AIM: To test whether a training program for neonatal nurses with a focus on these six breastfeeding-supportive clinical practices affects the rate of preterm infants exclusively breastfed at discharge to home, the postmenstrual age at establishment of exclusive breastfeeding, and maternal self-reported use of the practice in the neonatal intensive care unit, the.

   METHODS: A quasi-experimental multi-centre intervention study from 2016-2019 including a control group of 420 preterm mother-infant dyads, an intervention with a training program for neonatal nurses and implementation of weekly breastfeeding meetings for neonatal nurses, and an intervention group of 494 preterm mother-infant dyads.

   RESULTS: Significantly more preterm infants in the intervention group were exclusively breastfed at discharge to home (66.6%) than in the control group (58.1%) p = 0.008. There was no significant difference in postmenstrual age at establishment of exclusive breastfeeding between control and intervention group (37.5 vs.37.8 weeks, p = 0.073). Compared to the control group the number of infants continuing daily skin-to-skin contact after incubator care increased (83.2% vs. 88.3%, p = 0.035), infants using a nipple shield decreased (61.8% vs. 54.2%, p = 0.029), and the number of mothers initiating breast milk expression before six hours post-partum increased (32.6% vs. 42.4%, p = 0.007). There was a significant correlation between percentage of neonatal nurses participating in the breastfeeding training program and changes in exclusive breastfeeding rates (Pearson Correlation 0.638, p = 0.047).

   CONCLUSION: Exclusive breastfeeding rates in preterm infants and maternal self-reported use of breastfeeding-supportive practices increased by training neonatal nurses in the six clinical practices. It is important to include all nurses in the breastfeeding training program to ensure positive effect on exclusive breastfeeding rates.

Title
  Newborns at risk of Covid-19 - lessons from the last year. [Review]
Abstract
  After more than 1 year of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a great deal of knowledge on how this virus affects pregnant women, the fetus and the newborn has accumulated. The gap between different guidelines how to handle newborn infants during this pandemic has been minimized, and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)'s recommendations are now more in accordance with those of the World Health Organization (WHO). In this article we summarize present knowledge regarding transmission from mother to the fetus/newborn. Although both vertical and horizontal transmission are rare, SARS-CoV-2 positivity is associated with an increased risk of premature delivery and higher neonatal mortality and morbidity. Mode of delivery and cord clamping routines should not be affected by the mother's SARS-CoV-2 status. Skin to skin contact, rooming in and breastfeeding are recommended with necessary hygiene precautions. Antibodies of infected or vaccinated women seem to cross both the placenta and into breast milk and likely provide protection for the newborn. Copyright © 2021 Malika D.

Title
  The Development of Data Collection Tools to Measure Parent-Infant Closeness and Family-Centered Care in NICUs.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Preterm and sick infants benefit from parent-infant closeness and family-centered care (FCC) in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Prospective and feasible tools are needed to measure these care practices to facilitate their implementation.

   AIMS: To describe the development process of three prospective data collection tools that measure parent-infant closeness and the quality of FCC.

   METHODS: Data collection tools were developed in an iterative process consisting of three development cycles. Feedback was gathered from parents, staff, and researchers. The first stages of development focused on the content validity, appropriate scaling, and optimization of the response rate of these tools.

   RESULTS: The study included parents of 490 infants and the nurses working at bedside in 15 NICUs in six countries. The Parent-Infant Closeness Diary was developed to measure the daily duration of parental presence, holding, and skin-to-skin contact. The optimal duration for daily diaries was 14 consecutive days to maintain a good response rate. Parents provided reliable documentation of parent-infant closeness. Digital FCC tools covering the nine aspects of FCC for parents and nurses were developed to measure the quality of FCC. Participants provided answers on a 7-point Likert scale. Parents' response rates remained >50% for approximately 1 month, and the nurses' mean response rate was 55% (39%-87%) for the 3-month study period.

   LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: These new tools provide prospective daily information to aid the implementation of parent-infant closeness and the quality of FCC in NICU in different countries. They can be used to study and evaluate the implementation of these clinical practices NICUs in an international context. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

Title
  The first 2 h after birth: prevalence and factors associated with neonatal care practices from a multicountry, facility-based, observational study.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Amid efforts to improve the quality of care for women and neonates during childbirth, there is growing interest in the experience of care, including respectful care practices. However, there is little research on the prevalence of practices that might constitute mistreatment of neonates. This study aims to describe the care received by neonates up to 2 h after birth in a sample of three countries in west Africa.

   METHODS: Data from this multicountry, facility-based, observational study were collected on 15 neonatal care practices across nine facilities in Ghana, Guinea, and Nigeria, as part of WHO's wider multicountry study on how women are treated during childbirth. Women were eligible if they were admitted to the participating health facilities for childbirth, in early established labour or active labour, aged 15 years or older, and provided written informed consent on behalf of themselves and their neonate. All labour observations were continuous, one-to-one observations of women and neonates by independent data collectors. Descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regressions were used to examine associations between these neonatal care practices, maternal and neonate characteristics, and maternal mistreatment. Early neonate deaths, stillbirths, and higher order multiple births were excluded from analysis.

   FINDINGS: Data collection took place from Sept 19, 2016, to Feb 26, 2017, in Nigeria; from Aug 1, 2017, to Jan 18, 2018, in Ghana; and from July 1 to Oct 30, 2017, in Guinea. We included data for 362 women-neonate dyads (356 [98%] with available data for neonatal care practices) in Nigeria, 760 (749 [99%]) in Ghana, and 558 (522 [94%]) in Guinea. Delayed cord clamping was done for most neonates (1493 [91.8%] of 1627); other practices, such as skin-to-skin contact, were less commonly done (1048 [64.4%]). During the first 2 h after birth, separation of the mother and neonate occurred in 844 (51.9%) of 1627 cases; and was more common for mothers who were single (adjusted odds ratio [AOR; adjusting for country, maternal age, education, marital status, neonate weight at birth, and neonate sex] 1.8, 95% CI 1.3-2.6) than those who were married or cohabiting. Lack of maternal education was associated with increased likelihood of neonates not receiving recommended breastfeeding practices. Neonates with a low birthweight (<2.5 kg) were more likely (1.7, 1.1-2.8) to not begin breastfeeding on demand than full weight neonates. When women experienced physical abuse from providers within 1 h before childbirth, their neonates were more likely to be slapped (AOR 1.9, 1.1-3.9).

   INTERPRETATION: A high proportion of neonates did not receive recommended care practices, and some received practices that might constitute mistreatment. Further research is needed on understanding and measuring mistreatment to improve care, including respectful care, for mothers and neonates.

Title
  Risk factors for postpartum depression: An evidence-based systematic review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. [Review]
Abstract
  PURPOSE: Postpartum depression (PPD) is the most common psychiatric condition after childbirth which not only effects the mother's health, but also might have impact on child's development and parenting behaviors. Because the etiology of PPD has not been fully cleared, the efforts towards identification of risk factors are crucial for both the children and mother's health.

   METHOD: PubMed, EMBASE and PsycINFO databases were searched since inception until July 2019 to collect data about the risk factors of PPD and only systematic review and meta-analysis can be included.

   RESULT: To identify the real risk factors, protective factors and controversial factors, nineteen parts of the interpretation were adopted. The risk factors are mainly concentrated in the following aspects: violence and abuse, immigration status, gestational diabetes, cesarean section, depressive history, vitamin D deficiency, obese and overweight, postpartum sleep disruption and poor postpartum sleep, lack of social support, traditional dietary pattern (Japanese, Indian, United Kingdom, and Brazilian dietary pattern), multiple births, preterm and low-birth-weight infants, postpartum anemia, negative birth experience. The controversial factors are serum level of cortisol, thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies status, acculturation, traditional confinement practices. Skin-to-skin care, higher concentrations of DHA in mothers' milk, greater seafood consumption, healthy dietary patterns, multivitamin supplementation, fish and PUFA intake, calcium, Vitamin D, zinc and possibly selenium are protective factors.

   CONCLUSION: Thirteen risk factors were identified, but five factors still controversial due to the insufficient of the evidence. What's more, skin-to-skin care and some nutrition related factors are protective factors against PPD. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title
  Fetal Surgery for Open Spina Bifida in Canada: Initial Results.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Fetal myelomeningocele closure results in better infant outcomes than postnatal closure at the cost of potential prematurity and maternal morbidity. Our aim is to describe the setup of a fetal myelomeningocele closure program in Canada and document its outcomes.

   METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of all open fetal myelomeningocele closure surgeries performed at the Ontario Fetal Centre in its first 3 years of operation (2017-2020). Maternal and fetal baseline characteristics, surgical details, pregnancy outcomes, and infant follow-up until 1 year of age were recorded.

   RESULTS: Twenty-seven women underwent fetal myelomeningocele closure surgery, 10 of whom (37%) resided outside of Ontario. Mean gestational age at surgery was 25.0 +/- 0.7 weeks. All surgeries were technically uncomplicated and no fetal deaths occurred. There was a significant negative correlation between increasing experience and skin-to-skin surgical time (R2=0.36; P=0.001). Of the 26 patients who have delivered, 4 (15.4%) experienced preterm prelabour rupture of membranes. Mean gestational age at delivery was 34.9+/-3.0 weeks. All but 1 patient delivered by cesarean. Maternal complications occurred in 9 women (34.6%). There were no maternal deaths, but 3 (11.5%) infant deaths. Of the 14 surviving infants who have reached at least 1 year of age, 5 (35.7%) underwent ventriculo-peritoneal shunting. Of the 9 infants who have not yet reached 1 year of age, 3 (33.3%) underwent endoscopic third ventriculostomy and none underwent shunting.

   CONCLUSION: Fetal open spina bifida closure can be performed in Canada, with results similar to those reported by other international expert centres. Long-term follow-up is ongoing.

Title
  Attachment and relationship-based interventions for families during neonatal intensive care hospitalization: a study protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Attachment in the parent-infant dyads is fundamental for growth and development of children born prematurely. However, the natural process of attachment is interrupted just after preterm birth, and emotional and physical detachment, limited social interaction, and a traumatic, technologically heavy environment in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) may result in impaired attachment or bonding. To our knowledge, few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of interventions aimed at enhancing attachment, bonding, and relationships between parents and their preterm infants during the infant's hospitalization in the NICU. This study aims to perform a comprehensive systematic review and a meta-analysis survey of the effects of attachment- and relationship-based interventions in the NICU.

   METHOD: A comprehensive literature review will be conducted in the following databases: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed, EMBASE (OVID), Scopus, PsycINFO (OVID), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Web of Science. Selected studies will be published in English, in the last 20 years, from 1999 onwards. All studies of randomized controlled trials (e.g., parallel groups, cluster) will be included. We will consider studies evaluating attachment- and relationship-based interventions (e.g., skin-to-skin contact, parental involvement in infant care) versus a comparator (standard of care). The primary outcome will be maternal attachment. Secondary outcomes will include infants' growth and development, family health, and parenting experience. Data extraction from eligible studies will be conducted independently by two experts who will compare their data. The Cochrane risk of bias tool will be applied to the selected studies. If data permits, we will conduct random effects meta-analysis where appropriate. Subgroup and additional analyses will be conducted to explore the potential sources of heterogeneity considering gender of parents, infants' sex, and gestational age. Data synthesis will be carried out using the RevMan 5.3 software. Publication bias will be assessed with the graphical funnel plot method and the Egger test. The quality of the evidence will be rated using the methods of the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group.

   DISCUSSION: The results of this systematic review will discuss the types of attachment- or relationship-based interventions that are effective for facilitating family health outcomes and the babies' growth and development and will contribute to establishing new evidence in neonatal and family-centered care by providing scientific guidance for clinical practice and further research.

Title
  Preterm infants with severe brain injury demonstrate unstable physiological responses during maternal singing with music therapy: a randomized controlled study.
Abstract
  Preterm infants with severe brain injury are at high risk for poor outcomes and, therefore, may benefit from developmental care modalities such as music therapy (MT). In this prospective, randomized intervention, preterm infants with severe brain injury (grade 3 or 4 intraventricular hemorrhage or periventricular leukomalacia) who underwent skin-to-skin contact (SSC) with or without maternal singing during MT were evaluated for physiological responses, including autonomic nervous system stability (low frequency (LF)/high frequency (HF) power), heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and behavioral state. Maternal anxiety state and physiological data were also evaluated. A total of 35 preterm infants with severe brain injuries were included in the study analysis. Higher mean +/- standard deviation (SD) LF/HF ratio (1.8 +/- 0.7 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.25, p = 0.01), higher mean +/- SD heart rate (145 +/- 15 vs. 132 +/- 12 beats per minute, p = 0.04), higher median (interquartile range) infant behavioral state (NIDCAP manual for naturalistic observation and the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment) score (3 (2-5) vs. 1 (1-3), p = 0.03), and higher mean +/- SD maternal anxiety (state-trait anxiety inventory) score (39.1 +/- 10.4 vs. 31.5 +/- 7.3, p = 0.04) were documented in SSC combined with maternal singing during MT, as compared to SSC alone. Conclusion: Maternal singing during MT for preterm infants with severe brain injury induces physiological and behavioral instability and increases maternal anxiety during NICU hospitalization. A unique MT intervention should be designed for preterm infants with severe brain injury and their mothers. What is Known: * Preterm infants with severe brain injury are at high risk for poor outcomes. * Music therapy benefits brain development of preterm infants without severe brain injury, however it is unknown whether maternal singing during music therapy for preterm infants with severe brain injury is beneficial. What is New: * Maternal singing during music therapy for preterm infants with severe brain injury induces physiological and behavioral instability and increases maternal anxiety during NICU hospitalization. * A unique music therapy intervention should be designed for preterm infants with severe brain injury and their mothers.

Title
  Knowledge and attitude of health staff towards breastfeeding in NICU setting: are we there yet? An Italian survey.
Abstract
  The benefits of human milk in preterm infants, a population at high risk for developing adverse outcomes for which breast milk is a protective factor, are widely acknowledged. However, preterms' admission in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and newborn's clinical conditions have been described as significant barriers, leading to lower rates of breastfeeding initiation and duration. Healthcare workers play a crucial role in encouraging breastfeeding. We conducted a cross-sectional survey among nurses working in six Italian NICUs, exploring their knowledge and attitude towards breastfeeding. Although the majority of nurses had a specific breastfeeding education, our results show still some variations among answers regarding aspects of breastfeeding support in this setting. Specifically, family-centered care, transition feeding to the breast, and skin-to-skin practice, despite being extensively addressed by the Neo Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative, are the items that highlighted a range of answers that could result in conflicting information to mothers. Conclusion: By underlining the gaps of knowledge and attitude towards breastfeeding of nurses working in NICUs, this study provides an insight into what needs to be improved, with the aim of promoting higher rates of breastfeeding in the preterm population. What is Known: * Breastfeeding is particularly challenging in the preterm population, despite its universally recognized health benefits. * Improving healthcare professionals' knowledge and attitude towards breastfeeding has been shown to be crucial for promoting breastfeeding in NICUs. What is New: * Our results provide useful insight into nurses' knowledge and attitude towards breastfeeding in NICU settings. * By acknowledging strengths and weaknesses highlighted by this study, tailored strategies could be developed to improve health staff breastfeeding education and support to parents in NICU settings.

Title
  Influence of social determinants of health on skin to skin contact between mother and newborn.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: to analyze the association of skin-to-skin contact and social determinants of health.

   METHODS: this is a cross-sectional study with 187 medical records of newborns from a reference rooming in in northeastern Brazil. An instrument with maternal and neonatal data was used. Analysis was descriptive and inferential statistics. For the associations, a chi-square test was used to measure strength, an Odds Ratio was calculated, with a 95% confidence interval.

   RESULTS: 62% of newborns who made skin-to-skin contact at birth were eutrophic, full-term, Apgar > 7, mothers with prenatal care and without abortion. The determinants associated with non-skin-to-skin contact were preterm (CR=3.2;95%CI: 2.72-18.98); 1st minute Apgar < 7 (CR:2.9;95%CI: 2.38-3.06), cesarean section (CR:8.4;95%CI: 4.29-16.57), and unhealthy NB (CR 12.7;95%CI: 4.9-32.67). We used STROBE guidelines.

   CONCLUSION: skin-to-skin contact was influenced by gestational age, Apgar, delivery, and newborn health.

Title
  Nurturing and quiet intervention (NeuroN-QI) on preterm infants' neurodevelopment and maternal stress and anxiety: A pilot randomized clinical trial protocol.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: Primary objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the NeuroN-QI and the study procedures. Secondary objectives are to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the NeuroN-QI by the nurses, assess the nurses' training needs about the components of the NeuroN-QI, and estimate the preliminary effects of the NeuroN-QI on infants' neurodevelopment as well as maternal stress and anxiety at infants' 36 weeks of gestational age.

   DESIGN: A two-group pilot parallel randomized clinical trial stratified by center.

   METHODS: The pilot study will be conducted in two neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). A sample of 24 mother-infant dyads born between 26 and 316/7 gestational age will be randomized into an experimental or control group. Fifty nurses will be recruited. The NeuroN-QI consists of four 2-hour skin-to-skin contact sessions/week with a 15-minute auditory stimulation by mothers with controlled ambient levels of light and noise. A 1-hour quiet period will follow where infants will rest in their incubator/crib with their mother's milk for olfactory stimulation and where the light and noise control will be continued. In the control group, mother-infant dyads will do four skin-to-skin contacts per week and receive standard care. Acceptability and feasibility of the NeuroN-QI in addition to maternal stress and anxiety will be measured through questionnaires, while infants' neurodevelopment will be assessed with Assessment of Preterm Infant Behaviour and General Movement Assessment.

   CONCLUSIONS: This pilot trial will address knowledge gaps and generate evidence in neonatal care by evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of a multi-component developmental care intervention.

   IMPACT: This project is an innovative step towards optimizing the neurodevelopmental trajectory of infants in NICUs and consequently promoting their long-term health outcomes.

Title
  Mother-Infant Dyads with COVID-19 at an Urban, Safety-Net Hospital: Clinical Manifestations and Birth Outcomes.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe maternal characteristics and clinical outcomes of infants born to mothers with positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tests during pregnancy at an urban, safety-net hospital in Boston.

   STUDY DESIGN: We abstracted electronic chart data from 75 pregnant women with positive SARS-CoV-2 tests at any stage of gestation until 72 hours after birth who delivered consecutively between March 31 and August 6, 2020 at our center. We collected clinical data on maternal and infant characteristics, including testing, signs, and symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), delivery outcomes, newborn care practices (skin-to-skin care, location of care, and breastfeeding) and 30-day postdischarge infant emergency room visits and readmissions. We described categorical characteristics as percentages for this case series.

   RESULTS: Among 75 pregnant women, 47 (63%) were Hispanic, 10 (13%) had hypertension, 23 (30%) had prepregnancy obesity, and 57 (76%) had symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Regarding birth outcomes, 32 (41%) had cesarean delivery and 14 (19%) had preterm birth. Among 75 infants, 5 (7%) had positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction tests in the first week of life, all of whom were born to Hispanic mothers with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and had clinical courses consistent with gestational age. Six (8%) infants visited the emergency department within 30 days of discharge; one was admitted with a non-COVID-19 diagnosis.

   CONCLUSION: At our urban, safety-net hospital among pregnant women with positive SARS-CoV-2 tests, 41% had a cesarean delivery and 19% had a preterm birth. Seven percent of infants had one or more positive SARS-CoV-2 tests and all infants had clinical courses expected for gestational age.

   KEY POINTS: . Among 75 pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 positive testing at our center, five infants (7%) had one or more SARS-CoV-2 positive tests in the first week of life.. . Infants with positive SARS-CoV-2 tests had clinical courses expected for gestational age.. Copyright Thieme. All rights reserved.

Title
  Revisiting the roots of attachment: A review of the biological and psychological effects of maternal skin-to-skin contact and carrying of full-term infants. [Review]
Abstract
  During the early period of hypothesis building and empirical testing of attachment theory, a major emphasis was placed on mother-infant physical contact. In spite of this, mother-infant contact has received scant attention amongst attachment and child development researchers in the past decades. Here, a brief theoretical framework for mother-infant contact is presented, drawing on animal studies as well as human studies of preterm infants and neonates. Salient mechanisms may include an extended sensitive period during early infancy, requiring specific somatosensory stimuli for bio-behavioral homeorhesis; oxytocinergic and epigenetic pathways; kinesthetic stimuli and face-to-face proximity allowing for increased social interaction. Studies of extended human mother-full-term infant physical contact have demonstrated positive effects in multiple domains. For infants, these include sleep organization, temperature and heart rate regulation, behavioral response, crying/colic, socio-emotional development, attachment quality, speech development opportunities and mother-child interactions. For mothers, studies demonstrate improved depressive symptomatology, physiological stress regulation, contingent responsivity, breastfeeding and mother-child interactions. Parent-infant attachment quality has gained prominence as a trauma-resilience factor as well as a predictor of adult physical health. The potential role of mother-infant contact as an attachment promoting intervention as well as future research subjects are discussed. Current evidence supports the original attachment research that early maternal touch provision may influence infant socio-emotional development and attachment quality, with positive implications for mother-child relationship functioning.

Title
  Factors Associated with the Use of Pasteurized Donor Milk for Healthy Newborns: Experience from the First Human Milk Bank in Vietnam.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Pasteurized donor milk (PDM) is typically prescribed to preterm or low birthweight newborns when their mother's own milk is unavailable. In surplus, PDM is prescribed to meet the nutritional needs of healthy newborns in the first few days of life. However, its overuse can undermine efforts to promote and support breastfeeding, waste resources, and reduce the availability of PDM for at-risk newborns. We conducted this study to examine factors associated with the prescription and prolonged use (>48 h) of privately purchased PDM to healthy newborns.

   METHODS: Prospective observational study of 2440 mothers of healthy, term, and normal birthweight newborns born at Da Nang Hospital for Women and Children between April and August 2019. In addition to the descriptive analysis, we performed multiple logistic regressions to examine factors associated with the prescription of PDM (n = 2440) and prolonged PDM use among those who used PDM (n = 566).

   RESULTS: Twenty-three percent (566/2440) of healthy, term, and birthweight >=2500 g newborns received PDM and were included in the study. The prevalence of PDM use was higher for cesarean births (OR: 2.05; 95% CI: 1.66, 2.55) and among male newborns (OR: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.62), but lower for farmers or workers (vs. other jobs; OR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.54, 0.93), family income <10 million VND (vs. >=10 million VND; OR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.82), and duration of skin-to-skin >=90 min (vs. <90 min; OR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.76). Prolonged PDM use (12.4% of 566 newborns who used PDM) was associated with the mother having a higher socioeconomic status job (professional, small trader or homemaker; OR: 4.00; 95% CI: 1.39, 12.5), being a first-time mother (OR: 3.39; 95% CI: 1.92, 6.01) or having a cesarean birth (OR: 2.09; 95% CI: 1.02, 4.28).

   CONCLUSIONS: The prescription and prolonged use of privately purchased PDM was associated with non-medical factors unrelated to the ability to breastfeed effectively. The findings suggest the need for improved breastfeeding communication, counseling and support skills for health staff, development, and application of strict criteria on PDM use for healthy newborns and better routine monitoring of PDM use over time.

Title
  Mother's Own Milk Feeding in Preterm Newborns Admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit or Special-Care Nursery: Obstacles, Interventions, Risk Calculation. [Review]
Abstract
  Early nutrition of newborns significantly influences their long-term health. Mother's own milk (MOM) feeding lowers the incidence of complications in preterm infants and improves long-term health. Unfortunately, prematurity raises barriers for the initiation of MOM feeding and its continuation. Mother and child are separated in most institutions, sucking and swallowing is immature, and respiratory support hinders breastfeeding. As part of a quality-improvement project, we review the published evidence on risk factors of sustained MOM feeding in preterm neonates. Modifiable factors such as timing of skin-to-skin contact, strategies of milk expression, and infant feeding or mode of delivery have been described. Other factors such as gestational age or neonatal complications are unmodifiable, but their recognition allows targeted interventions to improve MOM feeding. All preterm newborns below 34 weeks gestational age discharged over a two-year period from our large German level III neonatal center were reviewed to compare institutional data with the published evidence regarding MOM feeding at discharge from hospital. Based on local data, a risk score for non-MOM feeding can be calculated that helps to identify mother-baby dyads at risk of non-MOM feeding.

  OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence, predictors and case fatality risk of hypothermia among neonates in Lira district, Northern Uganda.

   SETTING: Three subcounties of Lira district in Northern Uganda.

   DESIGN: This was a community-based cross-sectional study nested in a cluster randomised controlled trial.

   PARTICIPANTS: Mother-baby pairs enrolled in a cluster randomised controlled trial. An axillary temperature was taken during a home visit using a lithium battery-operated digital thermometer.

   PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: The primary outcome measure was the prevalence of hypothermia. Hypothermia was defined as mild if the axillary temperature was 36.0degreeC to <36.5degreeC, moderate if the temperature was 32.0degreeC to <36.0degreeC and severe hypothermia if the temperature was <32.0degreeC. The secondary outcome measure was the case fatality risk of neonatal hypothermia. Predictors of moderate to severe hypothermia were determined using a generalised estimating equation model for the Poisson family.

   RESULTS: We recruited 1330 neonates. The prevalence of hypothermia (<36.5degreeC) was 678/1330 (51.0%, 95% CI 46.9 to 55.1). Overall, 32% (429/1330), 95% CI 29.5 to 35.2 had mild hypothermia, whereas 18.7% (249/1330), 95% CI 15.8 to 22.0 had moderate hypothermia. None had severe hypothermia. At multivariable analysis, predictors of neonatal hypothermia included: home birth (adjusted prevalence ratio, aPR, 1.9, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.6); low birth weight (aPR 1.7, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.3) and delayed breastfeeding initiation (aPR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.5). The case fatality risk ratio of hypothermic compared with normothermic neonates was 2.0 (95% CI 0.60 to 6.9).

   CONCLUSION: The prevalence of neonatal hypothermia was very high, demonstrating that communities in tropical climates should not ignore neonatal hypothermia. Interventions designed to address neonatal hypothermia should consider ways of reaching neonates born at home and those with low birth weight. The promotion of early breastfeeding initiation and skin-to-skin care could reduce the risk of neonatal hypothermia.

Title
  Immediate parent-infant skin-to-skin study (IPISTOSS): study protocol of a randomised controlled trial on very preterm infants cared for in skin-to-skin contact immediately after birth and potential physiological, epigenetic, psychological and neurodevelopmental consequences.
Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: In Scandinavia, 6% of infants are born preterm, before 37 gestational weeks. Instead of continuing in the in-utero environment, maturation needs to occur in a neonatal unit with support of vital functions, separated from the mother's warmth, nutrition and other benefits. Preterm infants face health and neurodevelopment challenges that may also affect the family and society at large. There is evidence of benefit from immediate and continued skin-to-skin contact (SSC) for term and moderately preterm infants and their parents but there is a knowledge gap on its effect on unstable very preterm infants when initiated immediately after birth.

   METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this ongoing randomised controlled trial from Stavanger, Norway and Stockholm, Sweden, we are studying 150 infants born at 28+0 to 32+6 gestational weeks, randomised to receive care immediately after birth in SSC with a parent or conventionally in an incubator. The primary outcome is cardiorespiratory stability according to the stability of the cardiorespiratory system in the preterm score. Secondary outcomes are autonomic stability, thermal control, infection control, SSC time, breastfeeding and growth, epigenetic profile, microbiome profile, infant behaviour, stress resilience, sleep integrity, cortical maturation, neurodevelopment, mother-infant attachment and attunement, and parent experience and mental health.

   ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has ethical approval from the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (2017/1135-31/3, 2019-03361) and the Norwegian Regional Ethical Committee (2015/889). The study is conducted according to good clinical practice and the Helsinki declaration. The results of the study will increase the knowledge about the mechanisms behind the effects of SSC for very preterm infants by dissemination to the scientific community through articles and at conferences, and to the society through parenting classes and magazines.

   STUDY STATUS: Recruiting since April 2018. Expected trial termination June 2021.

Title
  Early parenting intervention promotes 24-month psychomotor development in preterm children.
Abstract
  AIM: Although parenting is key to promoting healthy development of at-risk preterm infants, parents have often restricted access to neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). This study aimed to assess the effect of an early parenting intervention on the psychomotor outcome in preterm children at 24 months of corrected age.

   METHODS: Forty-two preterm children and their parents were consecutively recruited at a level III NICU in Northern Italy and randomly allocated to early intervention (two educational peer-group sessions and four individual infant observation sessions) or care as usual (no educational or infant observation sessions). During NICU stay, parents provided information on daily holding and skin-to-skin. Psychomotor development was measured at 24 months of corrected age using the Griffith Mental Development Scales.

   RESULTS: There were no significant differences in socio-demographic and clinical variables between early intervention (n = 21; 13 females) and care as usual (n = 21; 12 females) groups. At 24 months of corrected age, children in the early intervention arm had greater scores for global psychomotor development as well as for Hearing-Speech and Personal-Social sub-scales, compared to those in the care as usual group.

   CONCLUSION: The present NICU parenting intervention was found to be associated with better psychomotor outcomes in preterm children at 24-month age. The effects were especially evident for domains related to language and socio-emotional functioning. Results are promising and should be retested with more heterogeneous and representative preterm sample. Copyright © 2020 Foundation Acta Paediatrica. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Title
  Measures of Lactation Outcomes in Women Delivering Preterm Infants.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Mother's own milk (MOM) is well known to decrease prematurity-related morbidities, yet mothers delivering preterm infants often produce insufficient quantities of milk to provide these benefits. Although a critical need exists for research to support lactation success in this vulnerable population, development and investigation of interventions to increase available MOM for infant consumption requires consistent, valid, and reliable measures of lactation outcomes.

   OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare and contrast methods of measuring lactation outcomes in mothers of preterm infants and evaluate their advantages and disadvantages.

   METHODS: Measures of lactation outcomes were reviewed and synthesized. Insights on best practices and future research directions are provided.

   RESULTS: Volume of MOM produced, lactation duration, and time to onset of secretory activation are important measures of lactation success. The most valid and reliable measure of milk production is likely weighing each vial of expressed milk combined with test weighing when infants breastfeed. Measures of lactation duration should include actual days mothers lactated rather than limiting to infant consumption of MOM as a proxy for duration and include not only whether mothers are lactating at infant discharge but whether they are also lactating at other health-relevant time points during hospitalization. Although time to onset of secretory activation is an important lactation outcome, information regarding valid and reliable indicators of onset in women delivering preterm infants is limited, and investigation of such indicators is a research priority. Variables that may affect lactation outcomes, including time to initiation of expression following delivery, duration of expression sessions, expression method, time spent in skin-to-skin care, maternal demographics and comorbidities, as well as maternal intent to lactate, must be considered when researchers investigate lactation outcomes in mothers of very low birth weight infants.

   DISCUSSION: Consistent and valid measures of lactation outcomes are required to produce reliable results from which evidence-based practice recommendations can be developed in order to improve lactation success in this vulnerable population.

Title
  Perinatal COVID-19: review of current evidence and practical approach towards prevention and management. [Review]
Abstract
  The clinical spectrum of the perinatal COVID-19 and prospective data on neonatal outcomes remains largely unexplored. Most of the existing literature is in the form of case series or single-centre experience. In this review, we aim to summarize available literature on the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 in neonates and mothers and suggest a practical approach towards management of clinical scenarios. This review explores the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in neonates born to mothers who were detected with the virus during the pregnancy. We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Google Scholar and Cochrane Database of Systematic Review between November 2019 and June 2020 and screened articles related to perinatal COVID-19. This review included 786 mothers, among which 64% (504) were delivered by caesarian section. There were 3 still births and 107 (14%) were delivered preterm. Out of 793 neonates born, 629 neonates (79%) were tested after birth. The commonest symptom in neonates was respiratory distress. Respiratory support was needed in 60 neonates (7.6%), with 14 babies needing mechanical ventilation (1.8%), 25 needing non-invasive ventilation and 21 needing nasal oxygen. Only 35 of the 629 tested neonates (5.5%) were positive for COVID-19. Of the 35 positive neonates, 14 (40%) were symptomatic. The COVID-19 seems to have favourable neonatal outcomes. Majority of neonates are asymptomatic. Respiratory distress is the most common manifestation. What is known: *COVID-19 affects all ages. *Neonatal disease is usually mild. What is new: *Vertical transmission is a possible route of infection in neonates. *Breast milk and skin-to-skin contact are safe in COVID-19-infected mothers if performed with appropriate use of precautions such as hand and breast hygiene and masking.

Title
  External barriers for including parents of preterm infants in a randomised clinical trial in the neonatal intensive care unit in Sweden: a descriptive study.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: Performing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in neonatal intensive care is challenging in many ways. While restrictive inclusion criteria or busy study protocols are obvious barriers, external barriers leading to termination of a study are seldom discussed. The aim of this study was to describe barriers for inclusion of families in neonatal intensive care in an RCT aiming to evaluate the effects of continuous skin-to-skin contact on mood and sleep quality in parents of preterm infants, as well as the quality of parent-infant interaction and salivary cortisol concentrations at the time of discharge.

   DESIGN: A descriptive study.

   SETTING: Three out of seven tertiary neonatal intensive care units in Sweden participated in a two-arm RCT that was terminated because of low inclusion rate.

   PARTICIPANTS: Before termination of the study, 11 out of 242 families assessed for eligibility were included for participation.

   RESULTS: The major barriers for inclusion in this RCT were external due to (1) lack of intensive care beds in the neonatal ward, causing medically stable infants to be transferred back to the referring hospital quicker than expected, (2) moving directly from the delivery room to a family room without passing an open bay intensive care room or (3) transferring from one neonatal ward to another with the same care level to increase availability of intensive care beds where needed. Other barriers were the inclusion criteria 'single-birth' and 'Swedish-speaking parent'.

   CONCLUSIONS: The major barriers for including participants were external constituted by transferals between neonatal wards and cities due to lack of intensive care beds. This is a multifactorial issue related to organisational structures. However, since this affects the possibilities to perform research this study highlights some suggestions to consider when planning prospective intervention studies within a neonatal setting.

Title
  Assessment of Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Practices and Preterm Newborn Gut Microbiota and 2-Year Neurodevelopmental Outcomes.
Abstract
  Importance: In very preterm newborns, gut microbiota is highly variable with major dysbiosis. Its association with short-term health is widely studied, but the association with long-term outcomes remains unknown.

   Objective: To investigate in preterm newborns the associations among practice strategies in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), gut microbiota, and outcomes at 2 years.

   Design, Setting, and Participants: EPIFLORE is a prospective observational cohort study that includes a stool sample collection during the fourth week after birth. Preterm newborns of less than 32 weeks of gestational age (GA) born in 2011 were included from 24 NICUs as part of the French nationwide population-based cohort, EPIPAGE 2. Data were collected from May 2011 to December 2011 and analyzed from September 2016 to December 2018.

   Exposures: Eight NICU strategies concerning sedation, ventilation, skin-to-skin practice, antibiotherapy, ductus arteriosus, and breastfeeding were assessed. A NICU was considered favorable to a practice if the percentage of that practice in the NICU was more than the expected percentage.

   Main Outcomes and Measures: Gut microbiota was analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and characterized by a clustering-based method. The 2-year outcome was defined by death or neurodevelopmental delay using a Global Ages and Stages questionnaire score.

   Results: Of 577 newborns included in the study, the mean (SD) GA was 28.3 (2.0) weeks, and 303 (52.5%) were male. Collected gut microbiota was grouped into 5 discrete clusters. A sixth cluster included nonamplifiable samples owing to low bacterial load. Cluster 4 (driven by Enterococcus [n = 63]), cluster 5 (driven by Staphylococcus [n = 52]), and cluster 6 (n = 93) were significantly associated with lower mean (SD) GA (26.7 [1.8] weeks and 26.8 [1.9] weeks, respectively) and cluster 3 (driven by Escherichia/Shigella [n = 61]) with higher mean (SD) GA (29.4 [1.6] weeks; P = .001). Cluster 3 was considered the reference. After adjustment for confounders, no assisted ventilation at day 1 was associated with a decreased risk of belonging to cluster 5 or cluster 6 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.21 [95% CI, 0.06-0.78] and 0.19 [95% CI, 0.06-0.62], respectively) when sedation (AOR, 10.55 [95% CI, 2.28-48.87] and 4.62 [1.32-16.18], respectively) and low volume of enteral nutrition (AOR, 10.48 [95% CI, 2.48-44.29] and 7.28 [95% CI, 2.03-26.18], respectively) was associated with an increased risk. Skin-to-skin practice was associated with a decreased risk of being in cluster 5 (AOR, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.04-0.48]). Moreover, clusters 4, 5, 6 were significantly associated with 2-year nonoptimal outcome (AOR, 6.17 [95% CI, 1.46-26.0]; AOR, 4.53 [95% CI, 1.02-20.1]; and AOR, 5.42 [95% CI, 1.36-21.6], respectively).

   Conclusions and Relevance: Gut microbiota of very preterm newborns at week 4 is associated with NICU practices and 2-year outcomes. Microbiota could be a noninvasive biomarker of immaturity.

Title
  Midwifery continuity of care versus standard maternity care for women at increased risk of preterm birth: A hybrid implementation-effectiveness, randomised controlled pilot trial in the UK.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Midwifery continuity of care is the only health system intervention shown to reduce preterm birth (PTB) and improve perinatal survival, but no trial evidence exists for women with identified risk factors for PTB. We aimed to assess feasibility, fidelity, and clinical outcomes of a model of midwifery continuity of care linked with a specialist obstetric clinic for women considered at increased risk for PTB.

   METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a hybrid implementation-effectiveness, randomised, controlled, unblinded, parallel-group pilot trial at an inner-city maternity service in London (UK), in which pregnant women identified at increased risk of PTB were randomly assigned (1:1) to either midwifery continuity of antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal care (Pilot study Of midwifery Practice in Preterm birth Including women's Experiences [POPPIE] group) or standard care group (maternity care by different midwives working in designated clinical areas). Pregnant women attending for antenatal care at less than 24 weeks' gestation were eligible if they fulfilled one or more of the following criteria: previous cervical surgery, cerclage, premature rupture of membranes, PTB, or late miscarriage; previous short cervix or short cervix this pregnancy; or uterine abnormality and/or current smoker of tobacco. Feasibility outcomes included eligibility, recruitment and attrition rates, and fidelity of the model. The primary outcome was a composite of appropriate and timely interventions for the prevention and/or management of preterm labour and birth. We analysed by intention to treat. Between 9 May 2017 and 30 September 2018, 334 women were recruited; 169 women were allocated to the POPPIE group and 165 to the standard group. Mean maternal age was 31 years; 32% of the women were from Black, Asian, and ethnic minority groups; 70% were in employment; and 46% had a university degree. Nearly 70% of women lived in areas of social deprivation. More than a quarter of women had at least one pre-existing medical condition and multiple risk factors for PTB. More than 75% of antenatal and postnatal visits were provided by a named/partner midwife, and a midwife from the POPPIE team was present at 80% of births. The incidence of the primary composite outcome showed no statistically significant difference between groups (POPPIE group 83.3% versus standard group 84.7%; risk ratio 0.98 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 1.08]; p = 0.742). Infants in the POPPIE group were significantly more likely to have skin-to-skin contact after birth, to have it for a longer time, and to breastfeed immediately after birth and at hospital discharge. There were no differences in other secondary outcomes. The number of serious adverse events was similar in both groups and unrelated to the intervention (POPPIE group 6 versus standard group 5). Limitations of this study included the limited power and the nonmasking of group allocation; however, study assignment was masked to the statistician and researchers who analysed the data.

   CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that it is feasible to set up and achieve fidelity of a model of midwifery continuity of care linked with specialist obstetric care for women at increased risk of PTB in an inner-city maternity service in London (UK), but there is no impact on most outcomes for this population group. Larger appropriately powered trials are needed, including in other settings, to evaluate the impact of relational continuity and hypothesised mechanisms of effect based on increased trust and engagement, improved care coordination, and earlier referral on disadvantaged communities, including women with complex social factors and social vulnerability.

   TRIAL REGISTRATION: We prospectively registered the pilot trial on the UK Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database (ID number: 31951, 24 April 2017). We registered the trial on the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) (Number: 37733900, 21 August 2017) and before trial recruitment was completed (30 September 2018) when informed that prospective registration for a pilot trial was also required in a primary clinical trial registry recognised by WHO and the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). The protocol as registered and published has remained unchanged, and the analysis conforms to the original plan.

Title
  Financial Support to Medicaid-Eligible Mothers Increases Caregiving for Preterm Infants.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of financial support on maternal caregiving activities for preterm infants.

   METHODS: We conducted a small randomized controlled trial (RCT) in two Massachusetts Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs). We enrolled 46 Medicaid-eligible mothers of preterm infants between January 2017 and June 2018 and randomly assigned them to a treatment group (up to 3 weekly financial transfers of $200 each while their infant was in the hospital) or a control group. We collected hospital-record data while the infant was admitted. The primary outcome was a binary variable indicating skin-to-skin care (STSC) was provided during a hospital day. Secondary outcomes included daily maternal visitation, daily provision of breastmilk, neonatal growth and length of stay (LOS). Multilevel generalized linear models with random effects were used to estimate treatment effects on daily maternal behaviors and ordinary least squares models were used to estimate impacts on neonatal growth and LOS.

   RESULTS: We assigned 25 women to the intervention and 21 to the control and observed them over 703 days of their infants' hospitalization. Mothers who received financial support were more likely to provide STSC (adjusted risk ratio: 1.85; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.31-2.62) and breastmilk (adjusted risk ratio: 1.36; 95% CI 1.06-1.75) while their infant was in the NICU. We see no statistically significant impact on neonatal growth outcomes or LOS, though estimated confidence intervals are imprecise.

   CONCLUSIONS: Our evidence demonstrates the potential for financial support to increase mothers' engagement with caregiving behaviors for preterm infants during the NICU stay.

Title
  Community-based cluster randomized controlled trial: empowering households to identify and provide appropriate care for low-birthweight newborns in Nepal.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Most newborn deaths occur among those of low birthweight (LBWt), due to prematurity &/or impaired fetal growth. Simple practices can substantially mitigate this risk. In low-income country settings where many births occur at home, strategies are needed that empower mothers to determine if their babies are at higher risk and, if so, to take measures to reduce risk. Earlier studies suggest that foot-length may be a good proxy for birthweight. An earlier Nepal study found a 6.9 cm cut-off performed relatively well, differentiating normal from low birthweight.

   METHODS: Community-based, cluster-randomized controlled trial.

   OBJECTIVE: to determine whether family-administered screening, associated with targeted messages improves care practices known to mitigate LBWt-associated risks.

   PARTICIPANTS: women participating in a parent trial in rural Nepal, recruited late in pregnancy. Women were given a 6.9 cm card to assess whether the baby's foot is small; if so, to call a number on the card for advice. Follow-up visits were made over the 2 weeks following the birth, assessing for 2 behavioral outcomes: reported skin-to-skin thermal care, and care-seeking outside the home; assessed restricting to low birthweight (using 2 cutoffs: 2500 g and 2000 g). Randomization: 17 clusters intervention, 17 control. The study also documented performance along the presumed causal chain from intervention through behavioral impact.

   RESULTS: 2022 intervention, 2432 control. Intervention arm: 519 had birthweight < 2500 g (vs. 663 among controls), of which 503 were available for analysis (vs. 649 among controls). No significant difference found on care-seeking; for those < 2500 g RR 1.13 (95%CI: 0.97-1.131). A higher proportion of those in the intervention arm reported skin-to-skin thermal care than among controls; for those < 2500 g RR 2.50 (95%CI: 2.01-3.1). However, process measures suggest this apparent effect cannot be attributed to the intervention; the card performed poorly as a proxy for LBWt, misclassifying 84.5% of those < 2000 as normal weight.

   CONCLUSIONS: Although the trial found an apparent effect on one of the behavioral outcomes, this cannot be attributed to the intervention; most likely it was a result of pure chance. Other approaches are needed for identifying small, at-risk babies in such settings, and targeting them for appropriate care messaging.

Title
  Assessment of rewarming methods in unplanned out-of-hospital births from a prospective cohort.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Mobile intensive care units frequently manage unplanned out-of-hospital births (UOHB). Rewarming methods during pre-hospital management of UOHB have not yet been compared. The aim was to compare rewarming methods used during pre-hospital management in a large prospective cohort of UOHB in France.

   METHODS: We analysed UOHB from the prospective AIE cohort from 25 prehospital emergency medical services in France. The primary outcome was the change in body temperature from arrival at scene to arrival at hospital.

   RESULTS: From 2011 to 2018, 1854 UOHB were recorded, of whom 520 were analysed. We found that using incubator care was the most effective rewarming method (+ 0.8 degreeC during transport), followed by the combination of plastic bag, skin-to-skin and cap (+ 0.2 degreeC). The associations plastic bag + cap and skin-to-skin + cap did not allow the newborn to be warmed up but rather to maintain initial temperature (+ 0.0 degreeC). The results of the multivariate model were consistent with these observations, with better rewarming with the use of an incubator. We also identified circumstances of increased risk of hypothermia according to classification and regression tree, like premature birth (< 37 weeks of gestation) and/or low outside temperature (< 8.4 degreeC).

   CONCLUSIONS: Using an incubator was the most effective rewarming method during pre-hospital management of UOHB in our French prospective cohort. Based on our model, in cases of term less than 37 weeks of gestation or between 37 and 40 weeks with a low outside temperature or initial hypothermia, using such a method would be preferred.

Abstract
  Body care and development of the premature infant. The observation of newborns' reactions to different stimulations enables their behaviour to be interpreted and the support provided to be adjusted. Developmental care such as swaddling, tucked posture and skin-to-skin contact favours the harmonious development of premature infants and encourages the parents to become involved in their care as early as possible.

Title
  Music Therapy for Preterm Infants and Their Parents: A Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial Protocol.
Abstract
  Music therapy (MT) interventions and skin-to-skin care (SSC) both aim to address the varied needs of preterm infants, including sensory regulation and stress reduction, inclusion of parents in their infant's care, support of parents' emotional state, and enhancing the parent-infant attachment process. Few studies have investigated the combination of both modalities through randomized controlled trials. Evidence of longer-term effects is missing. This article presents a study protocol that will investigate the effects of combined family-centered MT intervention and SSC on preterm-infants' autonomic nervous system (ANS) stability, parental anxiety levels, and parent-infant attachment quality. 12 clusters with a total of 72 preterm infants, with their parents, will be randomized to one of two conditions: MT combined with SSC or SSC alone. Each parent-infant dyad will participate in 3 sessions (2 in the hospital and a 3-month follow-up). The primary outcome of preterm infants' ANS stability will be measured by the high frequency power of their heart rate variability. Secondary outcomes will be physiological measures and behavioral states in infants and anxiety and attachment levels of parents. This trial will provide important, evidence-based knowledge on the use of the "First Sounds: Rhythm, Breath, and Lullaby" model of MT in neonatal care, through an intervention that is in line with the Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program model for supportive developmental care of preterm infants and their parents. Ethical approval (no. 0283-15) was granted from the local Institutional Review Board in April 2017. This trial is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03023267.

Title
  Compliance with the "Baby-friendly Hospital Initiative for Neonatal Wards" in 36 countries.
Abstract
  In 2012, the Baby-friendly Hospital Initiative for Neonatal Wards (Neo-BFHI) began providing recommendations to improve breastfeeding support for preterm and ill infants. This cross-sectional survey aimed to measure compliance on a global level with the Neo-BFHI's expanded Ten Steps to successful breastfeeding and three Guiding Principles in neonatal wards. In 2017, the Neo-BFHI Self-Assessment questionnaire was used in 15 languages to collect data from neonatal wards of all levels of care. Answers were summarized into compliance scores ranging from 0 to 100 at the ward, country, and international levels. A total of 917 neonatal wards from 36 low-, middle-, and high-income countries from all continents participated. The median international overall score was 77, and median country overall scores ranged from 52 to 91. Guiding Principle 1 (respect for mothers), Step 5 (breastfeeding initiation and support), and Step 6 (human milk use) had the highest scores, 100, 88, and 88, respectively. Step 3 (antenatal information) and Step 7 (rooming-in) had the lowest scores, 63 and 67, respectively. High-income countries had significantly higher scores for Guiding Principles 2 (family-centered care), Step 4 (skin-to-skin contact), and Step 5. Neonatal wards in hospitals ever-designated Baby-friendly had significantly higher scores than those never designated. Sixty percent of managers stated they would like to obtain Neo-BFHI designation. Currently, Neo-BFHI recommendations are partly implemented in many countries. The high number of participating wards indicates international readiness to expand Baby-friendly standards to neonatal settings. Hospitals and governments should increase their efforts to better support breastfeeding in neonatal wards. Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Title
  Nipple shield use in preterm infants: Prevalence, motives for use and association with exclusive breastfeeding-Results from a national cohort study.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND AIM: Prevalence and motives for nipple shield use are not well studied in preterm infants and recommendations of nipple shield use in preterm infants are inconsistent. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of nipple shield use, explore the motives for nipple shield use and elucidate the association with exclusive breastfeeding in preterm infants.

   METHODS: The study was part of a prospective survey of a Danish national cohort of preterm infants based on questionnaires answered by the 1221 mothers of 1488 preterm infants with gestational age of 24-36 weeks. Data on nipple shield use was available for 1407 infants.

   RESULTS: Nipple shields were used by 54% of the mother-infant dyads for many different motives and was more often related to breastfeeding problems associated with the infant than with the mother. The most common motive for nipple shield use was "infant slipped the nipple" (52%). The lower the gestational age, the more frequently nipple shields were used for motives related to the infant. For those using a nipple shield, only the motive "infant fell asleep at the breast" was associated with a higher risk of not breastfeeding exclusively at discharge (OR 1.90 (95% CI 1.15; 3.13), p = 0.012), and "breast too engorged" with a lower risk of not breastfeeding exclusively (OR 0.32 (0.16; 0.63), p = 0.001), but overall nipple shield use was associated with failure of exclusive breastfeeding.

   CONCLUSION: The present study does not give justifiable motives for nipple shield use, except for "breast too engorged". Nipple shields should not be recommended for infants falling asleep at the breast, instead, staff and mothers should be patient, allowing the dyad time skin-to-skin. The results indicate that the use of a nipple shield does not promote exclusive breastfeeding in preterm infants.

Title
  Newborn Health Indicators Associated with Maternal Age during First Pregnancy.
Abstract
  Delaying motherhood is becoming increasingly common, raising questions of the possible influence that maternal age may have on newborn health. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the association between maternal age and different newborn health parameters. An observational study was conducted in Spain on primiparous women and their infants. Data were collected on newborn health variables, breastfeeding, and different clinical practices that are beneficial for child health and development. Crude and adjusted mean differences were calculated along with the standard error of the mean. A total of 373 women and their children participated. In terms of early commencement skin-to-skin contact, the mean age of women that did skin-to-skin contact was 29.95 +/- 0.31 years compared to 31.49 +/- 0.66 years in those that did not (p = 0.042). In terms of other newborn parameters, such as preterm birth, health problems or complications, or the need for hospital admission, these were more frequent in the oldest group of mothers, but the differences found were not significant (p > 0.05). Hence, indicators of newborn morbidity were not found to be significantly associated with maternal age; however, beneficial practices such as early commencement skin-to-skin contact were found to be significantly associated with maternal age.

Title
  Acute Pain Assessment in Prematurely Born Infants Below 29 Weeks: A Long Way to Go.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: Neonates born extremely prematurely are at high risk of acute and prolonged pain. Effective treatment requires reliable pain assessment, which is currently missing. Our study explored whether existing pain assessment tools and physiological indicators measure pain and comfort accurately in this population.

   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively collected data in 16 neonates born at less than 29 weeks' gestational age during 3 conditions: skin-to-skin care, rest, and heelstick procedure for capillary blood sampling in the incubator. The neonates were video recorded in these situations, and recordings were coded using 5 observational pain assessment tools and numeric rating scales for pain and distress. We simultaneously collected heart rate, respiratory rate, arterial oxygen saturation, regional cerebral oxygenation, and the number of skin conductance peaks. All measures across the 3 conditions were compared using general linear modeling.

   RESULTS: The median gestational age was 27.1 weeks (range: 24.1 to 28.7). Forty measurement periods across the 3 conditions were analyzed. Heart rate was significantly higher during heelstick procedures compared with during rest, with a mean difference of 10.7 beats/min (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.7-18.6). Oxygen saturation was significantly higher during skin-to-skin care compared with during heelstick procedures with a mean difference of 5.5% (95% CI: 0.2-10.8). The Premature Infant Pain Profile-revised (PIPP-R) score was significantly higher during heelstick procedures compared with skin-to-skin care with a mean difference of 3.2 points (95% CI: 1.6-5.0).

   DISCUSSION: Pain measurement in clinical practice in prematurely born infants below 29 weeks remains challenging. The included behavioral and physiological indicators did not adequately distinguish between a painful situation, rest, and skin-to-skin care in premature neonates.

Title
  Neonatal hypothermia and associated factors within six hours of delivery in eastern part of Ethiopia: a cross-sectional study.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Neonatal hypothermia plays a significant role in increasing neonatal death by 80% for every 1 degree Celsius decrease of body temperature, especially in sub Saharan countries. A global burden of neonatal hypothermia indicated that 53% of Ethiopian newborns developed hypothermia due to different socio-demographic, behavioral, physiological and birth context related factors. However, the significance of these factors along the spectrum of public health institutions in the study area hasn't been yet studied.

   OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence and associated factors of neonatal hypothermia within six hours of delivery at public health institutions of Harar city, Eastern Ethiopia, 2018.

   METHODS: An institution based cross sectional study was conducted at Harar city after stratified followed by random selection of 3 public health institutions. Every other eligible newborn was included by systematic sampling to yield a sample of 403 newborns and their axillary temperature was measured by a calibrated digital thermometer within six hours of delivery from January 25 to February 19, 2018. A pre-tested anonymous questionnaire and checklist were used. The collected data were cleaned, coded and entered into Epi -data version 4.2 and exported to STATA version 12. Binary logistic regression model was considered and those variables with P < 0.25 in the bivariable analysis were included in to final model after which statistical significance was declared at P < 0.05. The goodness of fit was tested by Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic and Omnibus tests. Multi co-linearity was diagnosed using standard error and correlation matrix.

   RESULTS: The prevalence of neonatal hypothermia in the study area was 66.3% (95% CI: 61.1, 70.5%). No skin to skin contact (AOR = 2.87, 95% CI:1.48, 5.57), no wearing cap (AOR = 2.10, 95% CI:1.17, 3.76), no warm intra-facility transportation (AOR = 3.18, 95% CI: 1.84, 5.48), born to mothers having obstetric complication (AOR = 2.42, 95% CI:1.28, 4.57), prematurity (AOR = 3.37, 95% CI:1.53, 7.44) and neonatal health problem (AOR = 4.24, 95% CI:1.92, 9.34) were significantly associated with hypothermia.

   CONCLUSION: The prevalence of neonatal hypothermia was relatively high. Therefore, adherence should be made to the thermal care mainly the cost effective ones like wearing cap, skin to skin contact and warm transportation.

Title
  Addressing Disparities in Mother's Milk for VLBW Infants Through Statewide Quality Improvement.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: Among very low birth weight infants born from January 2015 to December 2017, the Massachusetts statewide quality improvement collaborative aimed to increase provision of (1) any mother's milk at discharge or transfer from a baseline of 63% to >=75%, (2) exclusive mother's milk at discharge or transfer from a baseline of 45% to >=55%, and (3) to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in provision of mother's milk.

   METHODS: We used the Institute for Healthcare Improvement Breakthrough Series framework in which our main process measures were receipt of prenatal education regarding human milk education, first milk expression within 6 hours after birth, and any skin-to-skin care on 4 weekly audit days in the first month. We examined changes over time among all very low birth weight infants and for 3 racial and ethnic subgroups (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic) using control and run charts, respectively.

   RESULTS: Of 1670 infants eligible to receive mother's milk at 9 hospitals, 43% of their mothers were non-Hispanic white, 19% were non-Hispanic black, 19% were Hispanic, 11% were of other races or ethnicities, and 7% were unknown. Hospital teams conducted 69 interventions. We found improvement in all 3 process measures but not for our main outcomes. Improvements in process measures were similar among racial and ethnic subgroups. Hospitals varied substantially in the rate of any mother's milk at discharge or transfer according to race and ethnicity.

   CONCLUSIONS: Our collaborative achieved similar improvements in process measures focused within the first month of hospitalization among all racial and ethnic subgroups. Reduction in racial and ethnic disparities in mother's milk at discharge was not reached. Future efforts will focus on factors that occur later in the hospitalization.

Title
  [Skin-to-skin practice and bonding in neonatal intensive care]. [Review] [French]
Abstract
  Neonatal intensive care is an emotionally charged unit. In addition to delivering specific care to the premature newborn, the role of the caregivers is to support the parents in their new role and to include them in the care. The creation of the bond between the parents and the premature infant in this context is specific. The children's nurse, through touch and the practice of skin-to-skin contact, can help them establish these first bonds. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Title
  Acceptability to nurses of reducing NICU light and noise levels during skin-to-skin care: A pilot study.
Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: Light and noise levels may influence preterm infants and their mothers when they are experiencing skin-to-skin contact [SSC] in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit [NICU].

   METHODS: A pilot randomized controlled trial [RCT] of an intervention aiming at reducing light and noise levels during SSC was conducted. Twenty-one neonatal nurses from a level III NICU completed questionnaires assessing their acceptability of NICU light and noise levels reduction during SSC, whether it interfered with their care delivery, in addition to acceptability of specific interventions reducing these levels.

   FINDINGS: The majority of nurses considered that the reduction of NICU light and noise levels during SSC was acceptable in general, did not interfere with their care delivery, and that the nine selected interventions were also acceptable.

   CONCLUSION AND RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS: Nurses found it acceptable to reduce NICU light and noise levels during SSC. These findings support the conduct of a full-scale RCT to evaluate the effect of such an intervention on preterm infants and mothers' well-being. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Title
  The effect of skin-to-skin care on postpartum depression among mothers of preterm or low birthweight infants: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Mothers of preterm or low birthweight (LBW) infants are at two to three times greater risk of postpartum depression (PPD) than mothers of healthy infants, which may be partially due to mother-infant separation during hospitalization. Skin-to-skin care could protect against PPD among these vulnerable mothers. We examined the effect of skin-to-skin care on PPD among mothers of preterm or LBW infants through a systematic review and meta-analysis.

   METHODS: We searched six peer-reviewed databases for prospective studies of skin-to-skin interventions that took place in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), used a validated PPD tool, and were published in English between 1979 and 2017. Data were standardized and pooled using Hedges method in a quality-weighted meta-analysis.

   RESULTS: Eight studies detailing seven interventions met inclusion criteria. Intervention characteristics varied with duration ranging from one week to over two months, skin-to-skin sessions ranging from 15 min to 1 h, and frequency ranging from thrice daily to thrice weekly. Five PPD tools were used predominantly as continuous measures. Meta-analysis demonstrated that skin-to-skin interventions were associated with a 1.04% reduction in standardized depression scores versus standard care (p < 0.001), though high heterogeneity was evident (I2 = 82.4%, p < 0.001).

   LIMITATIONS: Studies differed markedly with respect to design and intervention features, and were methodologically limited by using continuous depressive scores (not dichotomous PPD diagnoses) as the outcome.

   CONCLUSIONS: Skin-to-skin care has a small protective effect on maternal depressive scores, however the clinical relevance of this finding is arguably minimal. Additional well-designed studies are warranted to conclusively assess the effects of skin-to-skin on PPD. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title
  Supporting and enhancing NICU sensory experiences (SENSE): Defining developmentally-appropriate sensory exposures for high-risk infants.
Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: There is evidence to support the use of positive sensory exposures (music, touch, skin-to-skin) with preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), but strategies to improve their consistent use are lacking. The Supporting and Enhancing NICU Sensory Experiences (SENSE) program was developed to promote consistent, age-appropriate, responsive, and evidence-based positive sensory exposures for the preterm infant every day of NICU hospitalization.

   METHODS: A systematic and rigorous process of development of the SENSE program included an integrative review of evidence on sensory exposures in the NICU, stakeholder feedback, expert opinion, and focus groups.

   RESULTS: SENSE implementation materials consist of parent education materials, tailored doses of sensory exposures for each postmenstrual age, an infant assessment of tolerance, bedside logs and implementation considerations for integrating the SENSE program into the NICU.

   DISCUSSION: Research is needed to evaluate the SENSE program as an implementation strategy and to assess its impact on parent and infant outcomes. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title
  Parent and family perspectives on home-based newborn care practices in lower-income countries: a systematic review of qualitative studies.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: To understand family and parent perspectives on newborn care provided at home to infants in the first 28 days of life, in order to inform behavioural interventions for improving care in low-income countries, where the majority of newborn deaths occur.

   DESIGN: A comprehensive, qualitative systematic review was conducted. MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase and Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health databases were systematically searched for studies examining the views of parents and family members on newborn care at home. The search period included all studies published from 2006 to 2017. Studies using qualitative approaches or mixed-methods studies with substantial use of qualitative techniques in both the methods and analysis sections were included. Studies meeting the inclusion criteria were extracted and evaluated using Critical Appraisal Skills Programme guidelines. Following the initial selection and appraisal, barriers and facilitators to recommended care practices across several domains were synthesised.

   RESULTS: Of 411 results retrieved, 37 met both inclusion and quality appraisal criteria for methodology and reporting. Geographical representation largely reflected that of newborn health outcomes globally, with the majority of studies conducted in the region of Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Specific barriers and facilitators were identified among a range of domains including: cord care, drying and wrapping, thermal control, skin to skin contact, hygiene, breast feeding, care-seeking for illness, and low birthweight recognition. Cross cutting facilitators, common to all domains were evident and includeddelivery at a health facility, inclusion of female relatives in care counselling, lower healthcare costs, and exposure to newborn care behaviour change messaging in the community.

   CONCLUSIONS: When designing behavioural interventions to address newborn mortality at scale, policy-makers and practitioners must include barriers and facilitators important to families in low-income settings.

Title
  [Influence of family integrated care on the intestinal microbiome of preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit]. [Chinese]
Abstract
  Objective: To investigate the influence of family integrated care (FICare) on the intestinal microbiome of preterm infants in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Methods: This was a prospective observational pilot study. A total of 44 preterm infants (23 boys, 52%) admitted to NICU of the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University from July, 2015 to June, 2017 were enrolled and divided into FICare, non-FICare groups. Totally 20 term infants (11 boys, 55%) were enrolled into control group, who were sent to the Pediatric Healthcare Clinic for regular health check on postnatal 28-31 days. All infants were free from probiotics after birth and on full enteral feeding. Clinical data of all infants were collected. Two fresh stool specimens of infants in FICare group were collected after 2 weeks of FICare implementation, without use of antibiotics during the prior 1 week. Stool specimens of infants in non-FICare group were collected at the meantime;while for the infants in control group, stool samples were collected at 4 weeks of age. All specimens were stored in-80  freezer, subsequently investigated by 16 S rRNA sequencing. The results were filtered by paired-end reads software based on RNA overlapping-splicing and tags calculation. Operational taxonomic units (OTU) were analyzed for intestinal microbiome richness. Intestinal microbiome diversity was measured with Shannon index. One-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis H statistic analysis or Chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. Results: There were no significant differences among FICare, non-FICare and control groups in male proportion (52% (11/21) vs. 52% (12/23) vs. 55% (11/20), chi(2)=0.041, P=0.980), in-born ratio (90% (19/21) vs. 87% (20/23) vs. 85% (17/20), chi(2)=0.000, P=1.000), and percentage of infants with Apgar scores<7 at 5 minutes after birth (14% (3/21) vs. 9% (2/23) vs. 5% (1/20), chi(2)=0.120, P=0.729). Similarly, no significant differences were found between FICare and non-FICare groups in terms of gestational age ((29.7+/-1.8) vs. (29.9+/-1.7) weeks, t=0.378, P=0.707), birth weight ((1 266+/-310) vs. (1 326+/-318) g, t=0.631, P=0.531), median age of initiating feeds (4 vs. 4 days old, Z=0.666, P=0.505), and median age of achieving feeding volume of 120 ml/(kg.d)(13 vs. 11 days old, Z=1.014, P=0.310). However, the breast-feeding rate in FICare group (18/21, 86%) was significantly higher than that in non-FICare group (8/23, 35%) (t=11.780, P=0.001). The medium Shannon index was 0.72 (0.27,2.66), 0.61 (0.18,1.83), and 0.52 (0.08,1.71) in control, FICare, and non-FICare groups, respectively, without significant difference (H=1.823, P=0.402). The domain flora was Lactobacillus Firmicutes in all three groups, which was of the highest percentage in FICare group (71.6+/-5.4)%, followed by control group (65.4+/-6.6)% and non-FICare group (55.6+/-8.8)%, with a significant difference (F=27.919, P=0.000). Conclusions: FICare can improve the richness and diversity of intestinal microbiome, stimulate the establishment of flora close to those of normal breast-feeding infants in preemies in NICU, making its establishment being more similar to normal term breast-feeding infants. This effect might be caused by the increased skin-to-skin contact and increased fresh breast-milk-feeding in FICare.

Title
  Randomized controlled trial protocol to improve multisensory neural processing, language and motor outcomes in preterm infants.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Premature infants are at risk for abnormal sensory development due to brain immaturity at birth and atypical early sensory experiences in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. This altered sensory development can have downstream effects on other more complex developmental processes. There are currently no interventions that address rehabilitation of sensory function in the neonatal period.

   METHODS: This study is a randomized controlled trial of preterm infants enrolled at 32-36 weeks postmenstrual age to either standard care or standard care plus multisensory intervention in order to study the effect of multisensory intervention as compared to standard care alone. The study population will consist of 100 preterm infants in each group (total n = 200). Both groups will receive standard care, consisting of non-contingent recorded parent's voice and skin-to-skin by parent. The multisensory group will also receive contemporaneous holding and light pressure containment for tactile stimulation, playing of the mother's voice contingent on the infant's pacifier sucking for auditory stimulation, exposure to a parent-scented cloth for olfactory stimulation, and exposure to carefully regulated therapist breathing that is mindful and responsive to the child's condition for vestibular stimulation. The primary outcome is a brain-based measure of multisensory processing, measured using time locked-EEG. Secondary outcomes include sensory adaptation, tactile processing, speech sound differentiation, motor and language function, measured at one and two years corrected gestational age.

   DISCUSSION: This is the first randomized controlled trial of a multisensory intervention using brain-based measurements in order to explain the causal effects of the multisensory intervention on neural processing changes to mediate neurodevelopmental outcomes in former preterm infants. In addition to contributing a critical link in our understanding of these processes, the protocolized multisensory intervention in this study is therapist administered, parent supported and leverages simple technology. Thus, this multisensory intervention has the potential to be widely implemented in various NICU settings, with the opportunity to potentially improve neurodevelopment of premature infants.

Title
  Single-family room design in the neonatal intensive care unit did not improve growth.
Abstract
  AIM: The aim was to compare growth in very premature infants cared for in a single-family room (SFR) and an open-bay (OB) unit. We recorded duration of parental presence and skin-to-skin contact as proxies for parental involvement in care of their infants.

   METHODS: We consecutively included infants with gestational ages 28 + 0 through 32 + 0 weeks at two hospitals in Norway, one SFR unit (n = 35) and one OB unit (n = 42). Weight, length, and head circumference were followed from birth to four months after term date. Both units adhered to the same nutritional protocol and methods of recording events.

   RESULTS: The SFR mothers spent a mean (standard deviation) of 111 (38) hours and the OB mothers 33 (13) hours with their infants during the first week and 21 (5) versus 7 (3) hours per day later. The respective duration of skin-to-skin care was 21 (10) versus 12 (8) hours during the first week and 4.2 (2) versus 3.0 (2) hours per day later. The differences were similar, but less pronounced for the fathers. The growth trajectories did not differ between the groups.

   CONCLUSION: SFR care was associated with more parental involvement, but not with better growth. Copyright ©2019 Foundation Acta Paediatrica. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Title
  Probiotic research in neonates with congenital gastrointestinal surgical conditions - Now is the time.
Abstract
  Neonates with congenital gastrointestinal surgical conditions (CGISC) receive parenteral nutrition, get exposed to multiple courses of antibiotics, undergo invasive procedures, and are nursed in intensive care units. They do not receive early enteral feeding and have limited opportunities for skin to skin contact with their mothers. Many of these infants receive gastric acid suppression therapies. All these factors increase the risk of gut dysbiosis in these infants. Gut dysbiosis is known to be associated with increased risk of infections and other morbidities in ICU patients. Experimental studies have shown that probiotics inhibit gut colonization with pathogenic bacteria, enhance gut barrier function, facilitate colonization with healthy commensals, protect from enteropathogenic infection through production of acetate, reduce antimicrobial resistance, enhance innate immunity, and increase the maturation of the enteric nervous system and promote gut peristalsis. Through these mechanisms, probiotics have the potential to decrease the risk of sepsis and inflammation, improve feed tolerance and minimise cholestasis in neonates with CGISC. Among preterm non-surgical infants, evidence from more than 35 RCTs and multiple observational studies have shown probiotics to be safe and beneficial. A RCT in neonates (N=24) with gastroschisis found that probiotic supplementation partially attenuated gut dysbiosis. Two ongoing RCTs (total N=168) in neonates with gastrointestinal surgical conditions are expected to provide feasibility data to enable the conduct of large RCTs. Rigorous quality assurance of the probiotic product, ongoing microbial surveillance and clinical vigilance are warranted while conducting such RCTs. Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Title
  Racial and Ethnic Disparities in the Use of Mother's Milk Feeding for Very Low Birth Weight Infants in Massachusetts.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To examine the extent to which maternal race/ethnicity is associated with mother's milk use among hospitalized very low birth weight (VLBW) infants and maternal receipt of hospital breastfeeding support practices (human milk prenatal education, first milk expression <6 hours after delivery, lactation consultation <24 hours, any skin-to-skin care <1 month).

   STUDY DESIGN: We studied 1318 mother-VLBW infant pairs in 9 Massachusetts level 3 neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) between January 2015 and November 2017. We estimated associations of maternal race/ethnicity with any and exclusive mother's milk on day 7, on day 28, and at discharge/transfer and hospital practices. We estimated HRs comparing the probability of continued milk use over the hospitalization by race/ethnicity and tested mediation by hospital practices, adjusting for birth weight and gestational age and including hospital and plurality as random effects.

   RESULTS: Mothers were 48% non-Hispanic white, 21% non-Hispanic black, and 20% Hispanic. Initiation of mother's milk was similar across groups, but infants of Hispanic mothers (hazard ratio [HR], 2.71; 95% CI, 2.05-3.59) and non-Hispanic black mothers (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.17-2.07) stopped receiving milk earlier in the hospitalization compared with infants of non-Hispanic white mothers. Hispanic mothers had lower odds of providing skin-to-skin care at <1 month (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.43-0.87) compared with non-Hispanic whites.

   CONCLUSIONS: Hispanic and non-Hispanic black mothers were less likely than non-Hispanic white mothers to continue providing milk for their VLBW infants throughout the NICU stay. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Title
  Neuroprotective Care of Extremely Preterm Infants in the First 72 Hours After Birth. [Review]
Abstract
  Birth at extremely low gestational ages presents a significant threat to infants' survival, health, development, and future well-being. After birth, a critical period of brain development must continue outside the womb. Neuro-supportive and neuroprotective family centered developmental care for and standardized care practices for extremely preterm infants have been shown to improve outcomes. Neuroprotective interventions must include a focus on the emotional connections of infants and their families. Being in skin-to-skin contact with the mother is the developmentally expected environment for all mammals and is especially important for supporting physiologic stability and neurodevelopment of preterm infants.

Title
  Parent-Infant Closeness, Parents' Participation, and Nursing Support in Single-Family Room and Open Bay NICUs.
Abstract
  This was a prospective survey study, comparing parent-infant closeness, parents' perceptions of nursing support, and participation in medical rounds in single-family room (SFR) and an open bay (OB) neonatal intensive care units. Nurses' assessments of provided support were also measured. In total, 115 parents of 64 preterm infants less than 35 weeks' gestational age and 129 nurses participated. Parents recorded the presence and skin-to-skin care. Parents were sent 9 text message questions in random order. Nurses answered corresponding Internet-based questions. SFR mothers were more present, 20 hours daily (median) versus 7 hours (P < .001), initiated skin-to-skin contact (SSC) at 4 versus 12 hours (P = .03), and preformed SSC 180 min/24 h versus 120 min/24 h for mothers in the OB unit (P = .02). SFR fathers were also more present, 8 versus 4 hours (P < .001), initiated SSC at 3 versus 40 hours (P = .004), and performed SSC 67 min/24 h versus 31 min/24 h (P = .05). SFR parents rated participation in medical rounds and emotional support higher than OB parents. Parental trust was rated higher by nurses in the OB unit (P = .02). SFR facilitated parent-infant closeness, parents' participation in medical rounds, and increased support from nurses.

Title
  Human interaction in the NICU and its association with outcomes on the Brief Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (BITSEA).
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Extremely preterm infants represent one of the highest risk categories for impairments in social competence. Few studies have explored the impact of the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) environment on social development. However, none have specifically analyzed the effects of the care structure the infant receives during hospitalization on later social competence indicators.

   OBJECTIVE: To identify associations between the care structures received by extremely preterm infants in the NICU and scores on the Brief Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (BITSEA) post-discharge.

   PARTICIPANTS: 50 extremely preterm infants (mean gestational age: 25weeks during hospitalization; mean chronological age during follow-up assessment: 2years, 4months).

   METHODS: A secondary analysis of BITSEA data was performed exploring its relation to care structure data we extracted from electronic medical records (i.e., how much time infants were engaged in human interaction during their first thirty days of hospitalization and what types of interaction they were exposed to).

   RESULTS: Extremely preterm infants spend a considerable amount of time alone during hospitalization (80%) with nursing care comprising the majority of human interaction. Infants who experienced greater human interaction scored significantly higher on the Social Competence (p=0.01) and lower on the Dysregulation (p=0.03) BITSEA subscales.

   CONCLUSION: Human interaction and isolation in the NICU is associated with social competence and dysregulation outcomes in extremely preterm infants. Further research is needed to understand how various NICU care structures including centralized nursing teams, parental skin-to-skin care, and early therapy may synergistically play a positive role in developing social competence.

Title
  Determinants of hypothermia on neonates admitted to the intensive care unit of public hospitals of Central Zone, Tigray, Ethiopia 2017: unmatched case-control study.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify determinants of hypothermia in neonates in neonatal intensive care unit of public hospitals of Central Zone Tigray, Ethiopia in 2017.

   RESULTS: A total of 88 cases and 176 controls were included in this study. Ninety-one percent cases and 86.4% controls were in the 1st week of neonate age. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that delayed initiation of breastfeeding [AOR = 7.23; 95% CI (2.75, 18.99)], low birth weight [AOR = 8.51; 95% CI (2.71, 26.73)], preterm [AOR = 3.689; 95% CI (1.359, 10.012)], low APGAR score at 5th min [AOR = 3.71; 95% CI (1.57, 8.79)], skin to skin contact [AOR = 6.23; 95% CI (2.523, 15.358)], night time delivery [AOR = 6.25; 95% CI (2.58, 15.12)] and bathed within 24 h [AOR = 10.06; 95% CI (3.86, 26.22)] were independent risk factors of neonatal hypothermia.

Title
  Neonatal hypothermia and associated factors among neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care unit of public hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Neonatal hypothermia is a worldwide problem and an important contributing factor for Neonatal morbidity and mortality especially in developing countries. High prevalence of hypothermia has been reported from countries with the highest burden of Neonatal mortality. So the aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of Neonatal hypothermia and associated factors among newborn admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Public Hospitals in Addis Ababa.

   METHODS: An institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted from March 30 to April 30, 2016, in Public Hospitals in Addis Ababa and based on admission rate a total of 356 Neonates with their mother paired were enrolled for the study. Axillary temperate of the newborn was measured by a digital thermometer at the point of admission. Multivariate binary logistic regression, with 95% confidence interval and a p-value < 0.05 was used to identify variables which had a significant association.

   RESULTS: The prevalence of Neonatal hypothermia in the study area was 64%. Preterm delivery (AOR = 4.81, 95% CI: 2.67, 8.64), age of Neonate <=24 h old (AOR = 2.26, 95% CI: 1.27, 4.03), no skin to skin contact with their mother immediately after delivery (AOR = 4.39, 95% CI: 2.38, 8.11), delayed initiation of breastfeeding (AOR = 3.72, 95% CI: 2.07, 6.65) and resuscitation at birth (AOR = 3.65, 95%CI: 1.52, 8.78) were significantly associated with hypothermia.

   CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of Neonatal hypothermia in the study area was high. Preterm delivery, age <= 24 h old, no skin to skin contact immediately after delivery, delayed initiation of breastfeeding and resuscitation at birth were independent predictors of Neonatal hypothermia. Therefore attention is needed for thermal care of preterm newborn and use of low-cost thermal protection principles of warm chain especially on early initiation of breastfeeding, skin to skin contact immediately after delivery and warm resuscitation.

Title
  BUNDLE OF MEASURES TO SUPPORT INTRAHOSPITAL EXCLUSIVE BREASTFEEDING: EVIDENCE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS. [Portuguese, English]
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To identify the main recommendations found in systematic reviews regarding exclusive breastfeeding protective factors.

   DATA SOURCE: Integrative review based on the guiding question: What evidence is found in literature regarding the protective factors of exclusive breastfeeding during the intrahospital period? A search was conducted in the Cochrane Library, PubMed/MEDLINE and LILACS database using the keyword "Breast Feeding" and the word "Breastfeeding". Systematic reviews published from 2007 to 2016 that answered the guiding question were included in the study, whereas systematic reviews that analyzed breastfeeding of preterm infants and breastfeeding of children with orofacial malformation were excluded. The sample included eight systematic reviews.

   DATA SYNTHESIS: The recommendations related to the protective factors for exclusive in-hospital breastfeeding found in the systematic reviews were: early skin-to-skin contact, rooming-in care, intervention for treating painful nipples during breastfeeding, restriction of infant supplementation, baby-led breastfeeding and educational interventions and support for mothers during hospital stay. The proposed measures included the six practices presented as protective factors.

   CONCLUSIONS: The review enabled the identification of evidence to support the recommended measures from delivery room to hospital discharge, with the aim of encouraging breastfeeding and preventing intrahospital weaning.

Title
  Sustained Breastfeeding and Related Factors for Late Preterm and Early Term Infants.
Abstract
  The purpose of this pilot study was to determine the prevalence of sustained breastfeeding in late preterm and early term breastfeeding infants at 1 and 2 months of age and to identify the factors that were related to sustained breastfeeding. Subjects were identified through purposive sampling and completed the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale and data were collected on lactation support, hospital course details, and demographic factors. At 1 and 2 months of age, structured telephone interviews determined the current feeding status and postdischarge lactation support. Of 126 mothers, 82% sustained breastfeeding at 1 month and 71.2% at 2 months. Factors associated with sustained breastfeeding at 2 months included a college education (P = .014), higher day 1 breastfeeding scores (P = .007), higher Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy scores (P = .046), and continued maternal skin-to-skin contact (P = .007). High after day 1 breastfeeding scores were associated with sustained breastfeeding at 1 month (P = .000) and 2 months (P = .001). Unsustained breastfeeding at 1 and 2 months was associated with the occurrence of supplemental feedings (P = .001) and pumping at discharge (1 month, P = .002; 2 months, P = .015). Identifying the factors associated with the high-sustained breastfeeding rate in this population helps nurses focus on how to best support their breastfeeding experience.

Title
  Maintaining normothermia: Why and how?. [Review]
Abstract
  A high incidence of postnatal hypothermia has been reported in high-as well low-resource countries and it remains an independent predictor of neonatal morbidity and mortality, especially in very preterm infants in all settings. The temperature of newly born infants should be maintained between 36.5 and 37.5degreeC after birth through admission and stabilization. Interventions to achieve this may include environmental temperature 23-25degreeC, use of radiant warmers, exothermic mattresses, woollen or plastic caps, plastic wraps, humidified and heated gases. Skin-to-skin contact has been used, especially in low-resource settings. The combinations of these interventions applied to quality improvement initiatives, including staff training, use of checklists, and continuous feedback with the staff involved in the management of the neonate, are key factors to prevent heat loss from delivery room to admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. The admission temperature should be recorded as a predictor of outcomes as well as a quality indicator. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title
  Impacts of different methods of conception on the perinatal outcome of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy in twin pregnancies.
Abstract
  Twin pregnancies have a higher prevalence of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) than single pregnancies. It is unknown whether in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) influences the fetal outcomes in twin pregnancies complicated by ICP. This study aimed to explore the impact of IVF-ET on the perinatal outcomes of ICP in twin pregnancy. Clinical data from 142 twin pregnant women complicated with ICP were retrospectively analyzed, including 51 patients who conceived through IVF-ET (IVF group) and 91 patients with spontaneous conception (SC group). Several biochemical indicators and perinatal outcomes were analyzed. Compared to the SC group, the IVF group had a higher incidence of early-onset ICP (P = 0.015) and more frequent clinical symptoms (P = 0.020), including skin pruritus, skin scratch, and jaundice. Furthermore, the IVF group had higher rates of neonatal asphyxia (IVF vs. SC, 9.80% vs. 1.10%, P = 0.023) and premature delivery (IVF vs. SC, 96.08% vs. 83.52%, P = 0.027) compared to the SC group. The IVF-conceived twin pregnancy group had a higher risk of early-onset ICP and suffered from clinical symptoms and poor perinatal outcomes.

Title
  Interventions to prevent hypothermia at birth in preterm and/or low birth weight infants. [Review]
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Newborn admission temperature is a strong predictor of outcomes across all gestations. Hypothermia immediately after birth remains a worldwide issue and, if prolonged, is associated with harm. Keeping preterm infants warm is difficult even when recommended routine thermal care guidelines are followed in the delivery room.

   OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of interventions designed for prevention of hypothermia in preterm and/or low birth weight infants applied within 10 minutes after birth in the delivery room, compared with routine thermal care or any other single/combination of intervention(s) also designed for prevention of hypothermia in preterm and/or low birth weight infants applied within 10 minutes after birth in the delivery room.

   SEARCH METHODS: We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 5), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 30 June 2016), Embase (1980 to 30 June 2016), and CINAHL (1982 to 30 June 2016). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials.

   SELECTION CRITERIA: Trials using randomised or quasi-randomised allocations to test interventions designed to prevent hypothermia (apart from 'routine' thermal care) applied within 10 minutes after birth in the delivery room for infants at < 37 weeks' gestation and/or birth weight <= 2500 grams.

   DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used Cochrane Neonatal methods when performing data collection and analysis.

   MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-five studies across 15 comparison groups met the inclusion criteria, categorised as: barriers to heat loss (18 studies); external heat sources (three studies); and combinations of interventions (four studies). Barriers to heat loss Plastic wrap or bag versus routine carePlastic wraps improved core body temperature on admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or up to two hours after birth (mean difference (MD) 0.58degreeC, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.66; 13 studies; 1633 infants), and fewer infants had hypothermia on admission to the NICU or up to two hours after birth (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.67, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.72; typical risk reduction (RD) -0.25, 95% CI -0.29 to -0.20; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 4, 95% CI 4 to 5; 10 studies; 1417 infants). Risk of hyperthermia on admission to the NICU or up to two hours after birth was increased in infants in the wrapped group (typical RR 3.91, 95% CI 2.05 to 7.44; typical RD 0.04, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.06; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 25, 95% CI 17 to 50; 12 studies; 1523 infants), but overall, fewer infants receiving plastic wrap were outside the normothermic range (typical RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.81; typical RD -0.20, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.15; NNTH 5, 95% CI 4 to 7; five studies; 1048 infants). Evidence was insufficient to suggest that plastic wraps or bags significantly reduce risk of death during hospital stay or other major morbidities, with the exception of reducing risk of pulmonary haemorrhage.Evidence of practices regarding permutations on this general approach is still emerging and has been based on the findings of only one or two small studies.External heat sourcesEvidence is emerging on the efficacy of external heat sources, including skin-to-skin care (SSC) versus routine care (one study; 31 infants) and thermal mattress versus routine care (two studies; 126 infants). SSC was shown to be effective in reducing risk of hypothermia when compared with conventional incubator care for infants with birth weight >= 1200 and <= 2199 grams (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.64; RD -0.56, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.27; NNTB 2, 95% CI 1 to 4). Thermal (transwarmer) mattress significantly kept infants <= 1500 grams warmer (MD 0.65degreeC, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.94) and reduced the incidence of hypothermia on admission to the NICU, with no significant difference in hyperthermia risk.Combinations of interventionsTwo studies (77 infants) compared thermal mattresses versus plastic wraps or bags for infants at <= 28 weeks' gestation. Investigators reported no significant differences in core body temperature nor in the incidence of hypothermia, hyperthermia, or core body temperature outside the normothermic range on admission to the NICU.Two additional studies (119 infants) compared plastic bags and thermal mattresses versus plastic bags alone for infants at < 31 weeks' gestation. Meta-analysis of these two studies showed improvement in core body temperature on admission to the NICU or up to two hours after birth, but an increase in hyperthermia. Data show no significant difference in the risk of having a core body temperature outside the normothermic range on admission to the NICU nor in the risk of other reported morbidities.

   AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of moderate quality shows that use of plastic wraps or bags compared with routine care led to higher temperatures on admission to NICUs with less hypothermia, particularly for extremely preterm infants. Thermal mattresses and SSC also reduced hypothermia risk when compared with routine care, but findings are based on two or fewer small studies. Caution must be taken to avoid iatrogenic hyperthermia, particularly when multiple interventions are used simultaneously. Limited evidence suggests benefit and no evidence of harm for most short-term morbidity outcomes known to be associated with hypothermia, including major brain injury, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotising enterocolitis, and nosocomial infection. Many observational studies have shown increased mortality among preterm hypothermic infants compared with those who maintain normothermia, yet evidence is insufficient to suggest that these interventions reduce risk of in-hospital mortality across all comparison groups. Hypothermia may be a marker for illness and poorer outcomes by association rather than by causality. Limitations of this review include small numbers of identified studies; small sample sizes; and variations in methods and definitions used for hypothermia, hyperthermia, normothermia, routine care, and morbidity, along with lack of power to detect effects on morbidity and mortality across most comparison groups. Future studies should: be adequately powered to detect rarer outcomes; apply standardised morbidity definitions; focus on longer-term outcomes, particularly neurodevelopmental outcomes.

Title
  Associations Between Nurse-Guided Variables and Plasma Oxytocin Trajectories in Premature Infants During Initial Hospitalization.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Oxytocin (OT) is a social hormone that may help researchers understand how nurse-guided interventions during initial infant hospitalization, such as supporting human milk expression, promoting comforting touch, and reducing exposure to stressors, affect preterm brain development.

   PURPOSE: To determine whether factors related to human milk, touch, or stressor exposure are related to plasma OT trajectories in premature infants.

   METHODS: Plasma from 33 premature infants, born gestational ages 25 to (Equation is included in full-text article.)weeks, was collected at 14 days of life and then weekly until 34 weeks' corrected gestational age (CGA). Variables related to feeding volumes of human milk and formula; touch, as indexed by skin-to-skin contact (SSC) and swaddled holding; and clinical stressors were extracted from the electronic medical record. Linear mixed-models tested associations between nurse-guided variables and plasma OT trajectories.

   RESULTS: In the final model, same-day SSC was positively related not only to plasma OT levels at 27 weeks' CGA (beta= .938, P = .002) but also to a decline in plasma OT levels over time (beta=-.177, P = .001). Volume of enteral feeds (mL/kg/d), its interaction with CGA, and number of stressful procedures were not statistically significant (beta= .011, P = .077; beta=-.002, P = .066; and beta= .007, P = .062, respectively).

   IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Nurse-guided interventions are associated with infant plasma OT levels, suggesting nurses may impact the neurobiology of the developing premature infant.

   IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Replication with larger sample sizes and randomized controlled trial designs is needed to test effects of specific nursing interventions on infant OT.

Title
  Parent participation in the neonatal intensive care unit: Predictors and relationships to neurobehavior and developmental outcomes.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To 1) define predictors of parent presence, any holding, holding in arms, and skin-to-skin care in the NICU and 2) investigate the relationships between parent participation and a) early neurobehavior and b) developmental outcomes at age 4 to 5years among preterm infants.

   METHODS: Eighty-one preterm infants born <=32weeks estimated gestational age were prospectively enrolled within one week of life in a level III-IV NICU. Parent (maternal and paternal) presence and holding (including holding in arms and skin-to-skin care) were tracked throughout NICU hospitalization. Neurobehavior at term equivalent age and development at 4 to 5years were determined using standardized assessments.

   RESULTS: The median number of days per week parents were documented to be present over NICU hospitalization was 4.0 (IQR=2.4-5.8) days; days held per week 2.8 (IQR=1.4-4.3) days [holding in arms days per week was 2.2 (IQR=1.2-3.2) days and parent skin-to-skin care days per week was 0.2 (IQR=0.0-0.7) days]. More parent presence was observed among mothers who were Caucasian, married, older, or employed and among those who had fewer children, familial support and provided breast milk (p<0.05). More holding was observed in infants with fewer medical interventions (p<0.05) and among those who were Caucasian, had a father who was employed, had fewer children and family support (p<0.05). More parent holding in the NICU was related to better reflex development at term age (p=0.02). More parent skin-to-skin care was related to better infant reflexes (p=0.03) and less asymmetry (p=0.04) at term and better gross motor development (p=0.02) at 4-5years.

   DISCUSSION: Social and medical factors appear to impact parent presence, holding, and skin-to-skin care in the NICU. Parent holding is related to better developmental outcomes, which highlights the importance of engaging families in the NICU. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title
  Cortisol and blood pressure levels decreased in fathers during the first hour of skin-to-skin contact with their premature babies.
Abstract
  AIM: Premature birth is an extremely stressful experience. In 2013 to 2014, we explored the physiological stress responses of fathers during their first skin-to-skin contact (SSC) with their new baby.

   METHODS: We recruited 49 fathers whose partners had given birth to a premature baby of up to 33 weeks and three days. The study, in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of a Quebec hospital, measured the physiological stress responses of the fathers before and after they first experienced SSC with their new baby. Cortisol levels and blood pressure were measured, and a generalised estimating equation was used for the data analysis.

   RESULTS: The fathers' cortisol levels decreased from 10.55 nmol/L, with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of 9.61-11.59 at the beginning of the experiment to 8.26 nmol/L (95% CI: 7.51-9.07) after 75 minutes. Meanwhile, their systolic blood pressure decreased from 135.16 mmHg (95% CI: 130-140) to 125.25 mmHg (95% CI: 121-129).

   CONCLUSION: Fathers who held their baby in SSC for the first time showed a significant reduction in physiological stress responses. Our findings support hospital practices that enable fathers to experience their first intimate contact with their newborn infant in the NICU. Copyright ©2017 Foundation Acta Paediatrica.

Title
  Predictors of supplementation for breastfed babies in a Baby-Friendly hospital.
Abstract
  PROBLEM: Supplementation of breastfed babies is common during the hospital stay.

   BACKGROUND: The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) optimises practices to support exclusive breastfeeding, yet supplementation is still prevalent.

   OBJECTIVE: To determine predictors for supplementation in a cohort of breastfed babies in a Baby-Friendly hospital.

   METHODS: Electronic hospital records of 1530 healthy term or near term singleton infants and their mothers were examined retrospectively and analysed to identify factors associated with in-hospital supplementation using Poisson regression (unadjusted and adjusted).

   FINDINGS: Fifteen percent of breastfed infants were supplemented during their hospital stay. Analysis by multivariable Poisson regression found that supplementation was independently associated with overweight (reference normal weight) (aRR [adjusted relative risk]=1.46; 95% CI: 1.11-1.93); primiparity (aRR=1.40; 95% CI: 1.09-1.80); early term gestation (37-376 weeks, aRR=2.79; 95% CI: 1.88-4.15; 38-386 weeks, aRR=2.03, 95%CI: 1.46-2.82); birthweight less than 2500 grams (reference 3000-3499 grams) (aRR=3.60; 95% CI: 2.32-5.60) and use of postpartum uterotonic (aRR=2.47; 95% CI: 1.09-5.55). Greater than 65 minutes of skin-to-skin contact at birth reduced the risk of supplementation (aRR=0.66; 95% CI; 0.48-0.92).

   CONCLUSION: These identified predictors for supplementation, can inform the development of interventions for mother-infant pairs antenatally or in the early postpartum period around increased breastfeeding education and support to reduce supplementation. It may also be possible to reduce supplementation through judicious use of postpartum uterotonics and facilitation of mother-infant skin-to-skin contact at birth for greater than one hour duration.

Title
  Breast-Feeding Analgesia in Infants: An Update on the Current State of Evidence. [Review]
Abstract
  To provide an updated synthesis of the current state of the evidence for the effectiveness of breast-feeding and expressed breast milk feeding in reducing procedural pain in preterm and full-term born infants. A systematic search of key electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE) was completed. Of the 1032 abstracts screened, 21 were found eligible for inclusion. Fifteen studies reported on the use of breast-feeding or expressed breast milk in full-term infants and 6 reported on preterm infants. Direct breast-feeding was more effective than maternal holding, maternal skin-to-skin contact, topical anesthetics, and music therapy, and was as or more effective than sweet tasting solutions in full-term infants. Expressed breast milk was not consistently found to reduce pain response in full-term or preterm infants. Studies generally had moderate to high risk of bias. There is sufficient evidence to recommend direct breast-feeding for procedural pain management in full-term infants. Based on current evidence, expressed breast milk alone should not be considered an adequate intervention.

Title
  Risks and Benefits of Swaddling Healthy Infants: An Integrative Review. [Review]
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Swaddling has been practiced since antiquity; however, there is controversy about its safety.

   OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this review is to update and build upon previous reviews and synthesize evidence on risks and benefits of swaddling in healthy-term, near-term, or older infants.

   DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (1960-May 13, 2016) and CINAHL (1963-May 13, 2016) searches were conducted, relevant articles retrieved, and citation lists reviewed for other references.

   SYNTHESIS METHODS: A table summarizes study details. Selected older references and supporting literature are integrated into the synthesis to provide context.

   RESULTS: Swaddling calms infants and promotes sleep, but it is equally or less effective than other nonpharmacological methods in managing pain. There may be a slight risk for sudden infant death syndrome associated with supine swaddling, although the impact of confounding variables is unclear. Early skin-to-skin contact supports early breastfeeding, but swaddling does not have a negative impact on breastfeeding long term. Swaddling tightly around the hips is strongly associated with developmental dysplasia of the hip. More research is needed on the impact of swaddling on pain in term infants, infant vital signs, arousal thresholds, and a possible association between swaddling, vitamin D deficiency, and acute lower respiratory tract infection.

   LIMITATIONS: The number of studies was small, with few randomized control trials, and researchers used different definitions of swaddling.

   CONCLUSIONS: If a few precautions are taken, such as swaddling securely to minimize risk of unwrapping, avoiding overheating, placing infants to sleep supine, and discontinuing swaddling when infants first show signs of rolling over, swaddling presents minimal risk.

   CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Maternity and neonatal nurses should model swaddling practices based on the evidence and promote informed decision-making among infant caregivers.

Title
  Skin-to-Skin Contact Facilitates More Equal Parenthood - A Qualitative Study From Fathers' Perspective.
Abstract
  DESIGN AND METHODS: A descriptive design was used where 20 fathers of premature infants were interviewed using a semi-structured interview-guide. The guide contained the following five topics: the fathers' feelings about and experiences of using skin-to-skin contact (SSC), the physical environment at the Neonatal Intensive Care unit, staff attitudes, and whether SSC had any impact on the relationship with their partner and other children in the family. The interviews were analyzed using directed qualitative content analysis and the results compared with those of a qualitative systematic review by Anderzen-Carlsson and colleagues.

   RESULTS: The result shows that the fathers' overall experience of SSC was positive and as in the aforementioned review, they described experiences that were both gratifying and challenging. They felt more included and just as important as the mother because SSC and the demands placed on them by the premature birth helped them to achieve more equal parenthood.

   CONCLUSION: The fathers' overall experiences of SSC were positive as they felt included in their infants' care and just as important as the mothers. To a great degree the theoretical model tested was supported, although some weaknesses and differences were identified.

   PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: It is important to include fathers in neonatal care and recognize that they feel equally important as mothers in caring for premature infants. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Title
  The impact of cumulative pain/stress on neurobehavioral development of preterm infants in the NICU.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Vulnerable preterm infants experience repeated and prolonged pain/stress stimulation during a critical period in their development while in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The contribution of cumulative pain/stressors to altered neurodevelopment remains unclear. The study purpose was to investigate the impact of early life painful/stressful experiences on neurobehavioral outcomes of preterm infants in the NICU.

   METHODS: A prospective exploratory study was conducted with fifty preterm infants (28 0/7-32 6/7weeks gestational age) recruited at birth and followed for four weeks. Cumulative pain/stressors (NICU Infant Stressor Scale) were measured daily and neurodevelopmental outcomes (NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale) were examined at 36-37weeks post-menstrual age. Data analyses were conducted on the distribution of pain/stressors experienced over time and the linkages among pain/stressors and neurobehavioral outcomes.

   RESULTS: Preterm infants experienced a high degree of pain/stressors in the NICU, both in numbers of daily acute events (22.97+/-2.30 procedures) and cumulative times of chronic/stressful exposure (42.59+/-15.02h). Both acute and chronic pain/stress experienced during early life significantly contributed to the neurobehavioral outcomes, particularly in stress/abstinence (p<0.05) and habituation responses (p<0.01), meanwhile, direct breastfeeding and skin-to-skin holding were also significantly associated with habituation (p<0.01-0.05).

   CONCLUSION: Understanding mechanisms by which early life experience alters neurodevelopment will assist clinicians in developing targeted neuroprotective strategies and individualized interventions to improve infant developmental outcomes. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Title
  Investigating skin-to-skin care patterns with extremely preterm infants in the NICU and their effect on early cognitive and communication performance: a retrospective cohort study.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of the study was to investigate how patterns of skin-to-skin care might impact infant early cognitive and communication performance.

   DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study.

   SETTING: This study took place in a level-IV all-referral neonatal intensive care unit in the Midwest USA specialising in the care of extremely preterm infants.

   PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected from the electronic medical records of all extremely preterm infants (gestational age <27 weeks) admitted to the unit during 2010-2011 and who completed 6-month and 12-month developmental assessments in the follow-up clinic (n=97).

   OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures included the cognitive and communication subscales of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Third Edition (Bayley-III); and skin-to-skin patterns including: total hours of maternal and paternal participation throughout hospitalisation, total duration in weeks and frequency (hours per week).

   ANALYSIS: Extracted data were analysed through a multistep process of logistic regressions, t-tests, chi2 tests and Fisher's exact tests followed with exploratory network analysis using novel visual analytic software.

   RESULTS: Infants who received above the sample median in total hours, weekly frequency and total hours from mothers and fathers of skin-to-skin care were more likely to score >=80 on the cognitive and communication scales of the Bayley-III. However, the results were not statistically significant (p>0.05). Mothers provided the majority of skin-to-skin care with a sharp decline at 30 weeks corrected age, regardless of when extremely preterm infants were admitted. Additional exploratory network analysis suggests that medical and skin-to-skin factors play a parallel, non-synergistic role in contributing to early cognitive and communication performance as assessed through the Bayley-III.

   CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests an association between early and frequent skin-to-skin care with extremely preterm infants and early cognitive and communication performance.

Title
  The Dual Nature of Early-Life Experience on Somatosensory Processing in the Human Infant Brain.
Abstract
  Every year, 15 million preterm infants are born, and most spend their first weeks in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) [1]. Although essential for the support and survival of these infants, NICU sensory environments are dramatically different from those in which full-term infants mature and thus likely impact the development of functional brain organization [2]. Yet the integrity of sensory systems determines effective perception and behavior [3, 4]. In neonates, touch is a cornerstone of interpersonal interactions and sensory-cognitive development [5-7]. NICU treatments used to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes rely heavily on touch [8]. However, we understand little of how brain maturation at birth (i.e., prematurity) and quality of early-life experiences (e.g., supportive versus painful touch) interact to shape the development of the somatosensory system [9]. Here, we identified the spatial, temporal, and amplitude characteristics of cortical responses to light touch that differentiate them from sham stimuli in full-term infants. We then utilized this data-driven analytical framework to show that the degree of prematurity at birth determines the extent to which brain responses to light touch (but not sham) are attenuated at the time of discharge from the hospital. Building on these results, we showed that, when controlling for prematurity and analgesics, supportive experiences (e.g., breastfeeding, skin-to-skin care) are associated with stronger brain responses, whereas painful experiences (e.g., skin punctures, tube insertions) are associated with reduced brain responses to the same touch stimuli. Our results shed crucial insights into the mechanisms through which common early perinatal experiences may shape the somatosensory scaffolding of later perceptual, cognitive, and social development.

  Early neonatal death: A challenge worldwide. [Review]
Abstract
  Early neonatal death (ENND), defined as the death of a newborn between zero and seven days after birth, represents 73% of all postnatal deaths worldwide. Despite a 50% reduction in childhood mortality, reduction of ENND has significantly lagged behind other Millennium Developmental Goal achievements and is a growing contributor to overall mortality in children aged <5 years. The etiology of ENND is closely related to the level of a country's industrialization. Hence, prematurity and congenital anomalies are the leading causes in high-income countries. Furthermore, sudden unexpected early neonatal deaths (SUEND) and collapse have only recently been identified as relevant and often preventable causes of death. Concomitantly, perinatal-related events such as asphyxia and infections are extremely relevant in Africa, South East Asia, and Latin America and, together with prematurity, are the principal contributors to ENND. In high-income countries, according to current research evidence, survival may be improved by applying antenatal and perinatal therapies and immediate newborn resuscitation, as well as by centralizing at-risk deliveries to centers with appropriate expertise available around the clock. In addition, resources should be allocated to the close surveillance of newborn infants, especially during the first hours of life. Many of the conditions leading to ENND in low-income countries are preventable with relatively easy and cost-effective interventions such as contraception, vaccination of pregnant women, hygienic delivery at a hospital, training health care workers in resuscitation practices, simplified algorithms that allow for early detection of perinatal infections, and early initiation of breastfeeding and skin-to-skin care. The future is promising. As initiatives undertaken in previous decades have led to substantial reduction in childhood mortality, it is expected that new initiatives targeting the perinatal/neonatal periods are bound to reduce ENND and provide these babies with a better future.

Title
  A Quality Improvement Project to Increase Mother's Milk Use in an Inner-City NICU.
Abstract
  Mother's milk is recommended for preterm infants due to numerous health benefits. At our inner-city hospital, >80% of mothers of infants younger than 34 weeks' gestation initiated milk production, but fewer continued until discharge. Among infants younger than 34 weeks' gestation, we aimed to (1) increase any mother's milk use in the 24 hours before discharge/transfer to >75%; (2) increase exclusive mother's milk use in the 24 hours before discharge/transfer to >50%; and (3) reduce racial/ethnic disparities in mother's milk use.

   Methods: We conducted a quality improvement project from January 2015 to December 2017 focused on prenatal education, first milk expression <=6 hours after birth, and skin-to-skin care in the first month. We tracked process measures and main outcomes with run and control charts among 202 infants younger than 34 weeks' gestation eligible to receive mother's milk born at our hospital; We tracked results according to maternal race/ethnicity subgroups.

   Results: Forty-seven percent of mothers were non-Hispanic black, 28% were Hispanic, and 13% were non-Hispanic white. We improved the rate of first milk expression <=6 hours after birth and skin-to-skin care in the first month but did not improve rates of any/exclusive mother's milk use at discharge/transfer. Eight-five percent of infants had mothers that initiated milk production, but only 55% received any mother's milk at discharge/transfer.

   Conclusions: Our single-center quality improvement effort focused on infants younger than 34 weeks' gestation whose mothers were predominately Hispanic and non-Hispanic blacks. We successfully increased first milk expression <=6 hours after birth and skin-to-skin care but did not increase mother's milk use at discharge/transfer. Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

Title
  Exploring the Gap Between Needs and Practice in Facilitating Breastfeeding Within the Neonatal Intensive Care Setting: An Italian Survey on Organizational Factors.
Abstract
  Introduction: The system-level factors of the neonatal intensive care unit work environment contribute to breastfeeding promotion in the preterm population. The aim of this study was to investigate the operative policies related to breastfeeding support in a sample of Italian Neonatal Intensive Care Units. Materials and Methods: A multicenter cross-sectional survey was conducted, including a sample of 17 head nurses. The items of the questionnaire investigated the following areas: breastfeeding policies, staff education, family centered care, and breastfeeding promotion and support both in the neonatal intensive care units and after discharge. Results: Written breastfeeding policies were available for staff in all the neonatal intensive care units, most commonly addressing procedures related to skin-to-skin contact, human milk expression, and preterm infant breastfeeding. Most of the neonatal intensive care units correctly advised the mothers to initiate milk expression within 6 h from delivery and to pump milk at least 6 times/days. Breastfeeding training for the nursing staff was planned in the majority of the neonatal intensive care units although according to different schedules. With regard to the family centered care implementation, time restrictions were present in seven neonatal intensive care units, mostly occurring during the night shift, and the morning hours concomitantly with medical rounds. Moreover, in the majority of the investigated neonatal intensive care units, the parents were asked to leave the ward when their infant underwent a major invasive procedure or during the nurse/physician shift change report. With regard to breastfeeding promotion and support, eight neonatal care units had a multidisciplinary team with several health care professionals and 10 provided information about community-based support services. Most of the units assessed breastfeeding after discharge. Conclusion:  Based on the present findings, enrolled Neonatal Intensive Care Units appear to provide breastfeeding-supportive environments with special regard to breastfeeding policies, milk expression practices, interprofessional collaboration, and continuity of care. Health care professionals should exert efforts to ensure continuous and updated breastfeeding staff education and promote parent-infant closeness and family centered care.

Title
  An integrative review: maternal engagement in the neonatal intensive care unit and health outcomes for U.S.-born preterm infants and their parents. [Review]
Abstract
  Hospitals and perinatal organizations recognize the importance of family engagement in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) defines family engagement as "A set of behaviors by patients, family members, and health professionals and a set of organizational policies and procedures that foster both the inclusion of patients and family members as active members of the health care team and collaborative partnerships with providers and provider organizations." In-unit barriers and facilitators to enhance family engagement are well studied; however, less is known specifically about maternal engagement's influence in the NICU on the health of infants and mothers, particularly within U.S. social and healthcare contexts. In this integrative review, we examine the relationship between maternal engagement in the NICU and preterm infant and maternal health outcomes within the U.S. Results from the 33 articles that met inclusion criteria indicate that maternal engagement in the NICU is associated with infant outcomes, maternal health-behavior outcomes, maternal mental health outcomes, maternal-child bonding outcomes, and breastfeeding outcomes. Skin-to-skin holding is the most studied maternal engagement activity in the U.S. preterm NICU population. Further research is needed to understand what types of engagement are most salient, how they should be measured, and which immediate outcomes are the best predictors of long-term health and well-being.

Title
  Calmer: a robot for managing acute pain effectively in preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit.
Abstract
  Introduction: For preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit, early exposure to repeated procedural pain is associated with negative effects on the brain. Skin-to-skin contact with parents has pain-mitigating properties, but parents may not always be available during procedures. Calmer, a robotic device that simulates key pain-reducing components of skin-to-skin contact, including heart beat sounds, breathing motion, and touch, was developed to augment clinical pain management.

   Objective: Our objective was to evaluate the initial efficacy of Calmer for mitigating pain in preterm infants. We hypothesized that, compared to babies who received a human touch-based treatment, facilitated tucking, infants on Calmer would have lower behavioural and physiological pain indices during a single blood test required for clinical care.

   Methods: Forty-nine preterm infants, born between 27 and 36 weeks of gestational age, were randomized either to facilitated tucking or Calmer treatment. Differences between groups in changes across 4 procedure phases (baseline 1, baseline 2, poke, and recovery) were evaluated using (1) the Behavioral Indicators of Infant Pain scored by blind coders from bedside videotape and (2) heart rate and heart rate variability continuously recorded from a single-lead surface ECG (lead II) (Biopac, Canada) sampled at 1000 Hz using a specially adapted portable computer system and processed using Mindware.

   Results: No significant differences were found between groups on any outcome measures.

   Conclusion: Calmer provided similar treatment efficacy to a human touch-based treatment. More research is needed to determine effects of Calmer for stress reduction in preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit over longer periods.

Title
  Predictors of early initiation of breastfeeding among Zimbabwean women: secondary analysis of ZDHS 2015.
Abstract
  Background: The World Health Organization recommends initiation of breastfeeding within the first hour of delivery. Early initiation is beneficial for both mother and baby. Previous Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Surveys (ZDHS) have shown reduction in early initiation of breast feeding from 68% (2005/06) to 58% (2015). This study sought to investigate factors associated with early initiation of breast feeding among women aged 15-49 years in Zimbabwe.

   Methodology: Secondary analysis of ZDHS 2015 data was done to investigate the association between early initiation of breast feeding and maternal, provider and neonatal factors using multivariate logistic regression (n = 2192).

   Results: The majority of the study sample (78%) reported having practised early initiation of breastfeeding during their most recent delivery (preceding 24 months). Children who were put on skin to skin contact (AOR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.13-2.02) and those delivered by skilled attendants (AOR = 4.36, 95% CI 1.07-17.77) had greater odds of early initiation compared to those who were not. Other factors associated with early initiation were multiparity (AOR 1.82 95% CI 1.33-2.49) and rural residence (AOR 2.10 95% 1.12-3.93). However, having an abnormal birth weight, i.e. low birth weight (AOR 0.60 95% CI 0.36-0.99) and macrosomia (AOR = 0.42, CI 0.22-0.79) as well as delivery by caesarean section (AOR 0.1195% CI 0.06-0.19) were associated with reduced odds of early initiation.

   Conclusion: Early initiation of breast feeding in Zimbabwe is mainly associated with residing in the rural areas and multiparity. The 78% rate of early initiation of breastfeeding was contrary to the 58% reported in the ZDHS findings. Interventions targeting an improvement in early initiation of breastfeeding must aim at women who deliver by caesarean section, women with babies of abnormal birth weight, primi-parous women and women residing in rural areas.

Title
  A Review of Non-Pharmacological Treatments for Pain Management in Newborn Infants. [Review]
Abstract
  Pain is a major problem in sick newborn infants, especially for those needing intensive care. Pharmacological pain relief is the most commonly used, but might be ineffective and has side effects, including long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae. The effectiveness and safety of alternative analgesic methods are ambiguous. The objective was to review the effectiveness and safety of non-pharmacological methods of pain relief in newborn infants and to identify those that are the most effective. PubMed and Google Scholar were searched using the terms: "infant", "premature", "pain", "acupuncture", "skin-to-skin contact", "sucrose", "massage", "musical therapy" and 'breastfeeding'. We included 24 studies assessing different methods of non-pharmacological analgesic techniques. Most resulted in some degree of analgesia but many were ineffective and some were even detrimental. Sucrose, for example, was often ineffective but was more effective than music therapy, massage, breast milk (for extremely premature infants) or non-invasive electrical stimulation acupuncture. There were also conflicting results for acupuncture, skin-to-skin care and musical therapy. Most non-pharmacological methods of analgesia provide a modicum of relief for preterm infants, but none are completely effective and there is no clearly superior method. Study is also required to assess potential long-term consequences of any of these methods.

Title
  Use of Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles to decrease incidence of neonatal hypothermia in the labor room.
Abstract
  Background: Body temperature of a neonate continues to be under-documented, under-recognized, and under-managed, even though studies have shown that neonatal hypothermia increases mortality and morbidity. We aimed to reduce neonatal hypothermia (body temperature <36.5 degreeC) at 1 h following normal vaginal delivery in term and late preterm neonates in delivery room from 50% at baseline to less than 10% by 6 weeks.

   Methods: We implemented a quality improvement (QI) initiative using the rapid-cycle Plan-Do-Study-Act approach (PDSA) improvement model and the project was conducted from 15 Jan 2017 to 25 Feb 2017. All singleton neonates with gestational ages above 34 completed weeks born by vaginal delivery were targeted. Exclusion criteria included neonates needing any form of resuscitation, those developing respiratory distress after birth needing any form of respiratory support or observation in NICU. We ran PDSA cycles (including pre-warmed cloths, skin to skin care with mother, early breast feeding, delaying weight check by 1 h and checklist of planned steps), every week, after taking the baseline data in the first week.

   Results: A total of 46 neonates were studied. After 4 PDSA cycles, incidence of neonatal hypothermia at 1 h of birth dropped to zero from 50% at baseline and we were able to sustain 100% normal temperature (36.5-37.5 degreeC) since then.

   Conclusion: This QI project has significantly reduced the incidence of hypothermia in term and late preterm neonates born by vaginal delivery in our institute.

Title
  Effects of Skin-to-Skin Care on Late Preterm and Term Infants At-Risk for Neonatal Hypoglycemia.
Abstract
  Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of prolonged skin-to-skin care (SSC) during blood glucose monitoring (12-24 hours) in late preterm and term infants at-risk for neonatal hypoglycemia (NH).

   Study design: We conducted a retrospective pre- and postintervention study. We compared late preterm and term infants at-risk for NH born in a 1-year period before the SSC intervention, May 1, 2013, to April 30, 2014 (pre-SSC) to at-risk infants born in the year following the implementation of SSC intervention, May 1, 2014, to April 30, 2015 (post-SSC).

   Results: The number of hypoglycemia admissions to neonatal intensive care unit among at-risk infants for NH decreased significantly from 8.1% pre-SSC period to 3.5% post-SSC period (P = 0.018). The number of infants receiving intravenous dextrose bolus in the newborn nursery also decreased significantly from 5.9% to 2.1% (P = 0.02). Number of infants discharged exclusively breastfeeding increased from 36.4% to 45.7%, although not statistically significant (P = 0.074).

   Conclusion: This SSC intervention, as implemented in our hospital, was associated with a significant decrease in newborn hypoglycemia admissions to neonatal intensive care unit. The SSC intervention was safe and feasible with no adverse events.

Title
  Early skin-to-skin contact between healthy late preterm infants and their parents: an observational cohort study.
Abstract
  Background: Skin-to-skin contact (SSC) is an important factor to consider in the care of late preterm infants (born between 34 0/7 and 36 6/7 completed weeks of gestation). The literature suggests that SSC between preterm infants and their mothers facilitates breastfeeding. However, more studies are needed to explore potential dose-response effects between SSC and breastfeeding as well as studies that explicitly investigate SSC by fathers among late preterm infants. The aim was to investigate the duration of healthy late preterm infants' SSC with the mother and father, respectively, during the first 48 h after birth and the associations with breastfeeding (exclusive/partial at discharged), clinical and demographic variables.

   Methods: This was an observational cohort study in which parents to healthy late preterm infants, born between 34 5/7 and 36 6/7 completed weeks of gestation, recorded duration of SSC provided by mother and father, respectively. Demographic and clinical variables were retrieved from the medical records and were used as predictors. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to assess the association between the predictors and the outcome, SSC (hours), separately for mothers and fathers.

   Results: The mean (standard deviation [SD]) time per day spent with SSC with mothers (n = 64) and fathers (n = 64), was 14.7 (5.6) and 4.4 (3.3) hours during the first day (24 h) after birth and 9.2 (7.1) and 3.1 (3.3) hours during the second day (24 h), respectively. Regarding SSC with mothers, no variable was significantly associated with SSC during the first day, while the mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) time of SSC during the second day was 6.9 (1.4-12.4) hours shorter for each additional kg of birthweight (p = 0.014). Concerning SSC with fathers, the mean (95% CI) time of SSC during the first day was 2.1 (0.4-3.7) hours longer for infants born at night (p = 0.015), 1.7 (0.1-3.2) hours longer for boys (p = 0.033), 3.2 (1.2-5.2) hours longer for infants born by caesarean section (p = 0.003), and 1.6 (0.1-3.1) hours longer for infants exclusively breastfed at discharge (p = 0.040). During the second day, the mean (95% CI) time of SSC with fathers was 3.0 (0.6-5.4) hours shorter for each additional kg of birthweight (p = 0.014), 2.0 (0.5-3.6) hours longer for infants born during night-time (p = 0.011), 2.9 (1.4-4.4) hours longer if the mother was primipara (p < 0.001), and 1.9 (0.3-3.5) hours shorter if supplementary artificial milk feeds were given. None of the other predictors, i.e., mother's age, gestational age, or induction of labor were significantly associated with infants' SSC with mothers or fathers during any of the first two days after birth.

   Conclusion: Future studies are warranted that investigate duration of SSC between late preterm infants and their parents separately and the associations with breastfeeding and other variables of clinical importance.

Title
  Newborn Skin: Common Skin Problems.
Abstract
  The newborn skin can be separated from adult's skin in several ways. In dermatologic examination it can be easily observed that it is thinner, less hairy and has less sweat and sebaceous gland secretions. These differentiations present especially in preterm newborns. Their skin is exposed to mechanical trauma, bacteria and weather, heat alterations. At birth, newborn skin is protected by the coverage of vernix caseosa, which has lubricating and antibacterial features and its pH ranges from 6.7 to 7.4. Beneath the vernix caseosa the skin has a pH of 5.5-6.0. In newborn dermatologic examination it is very important to distinguish transient benign dermatoses and severe diseases, make early diagnosis and treat congenital skin disorders. Although the benign cases are common in this life period, clinical presentations can be much more exaggerated, dramatic and cause a great deal of anxiety to parents. Therefore, as a doctor, knowing the dermatological, pathological and non-pathological common skin rashes guides the family in the right direction, offers advice to reduce uncertainty and time for the treatment of severe conditions and builds a confidential doctor-patient relationship. In this review, our aim is to provide a general overview to common skin rashes in newborn period.

Title
  [Parental perception of their involvement in the care of their children in French neonatal units]. [French]
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The experience of becoming the parent of a sick or premature newborn can be particularly distressing for parents. They often encounter challenges to the development of their parenting roles. Perception of the hospital stay has never been analyzed on a large scale.

   OBJECTIVE: To analyze parents' perception of their involvement in the care of their newborn.

   METHODS: An internet-based survey started in France in February 2014 on the basis of a validated questionnaire composed of 222 neonatal care-related items. A quantitative and qualitative analysis was performed on the items dealing with parents' involvement until August 2014.

   RESULTS: The survey was completed by 1500 parents, 98 % of whom were mothers. The infants had a mean GA of 32 weeks and a mean birth weight of 1600g. Parents rated their first care of their infant with mixed emotions (joy, stress, etc.). Parents were willing to practice new skills through guided participation, even for more complex care. Skin-to-skin care was only proposed after 7 days for 20 % of the parents; 10 % of the parents did not feel secure during this practice. The need for privacy and professional guidance was essential for meaningful skin-to-skin contact.

   DISCUSSION: Parents' perception of participating actively in their infant's care was positive and they felt guided by the nursing team. Most of them would have been more active with guidance. Skin-to-skin care was appreciated and desired, but could become stressful if the conditions were not optimal. Copyright © 2016. Published by Elsevier SAS.

Title
  Design, Implementation, and Early Outcome Indicators of a New Family-Integrated Neonatal Unit.
Abstract
  Neonatal units are becoming more family-centered based on evidence of improved health outcomes when parents provide care to newborns. Physical environment constraints, as well as nursing care traditions and practices, have been barriers to providing care that includes close parental involvement. Our hospital's experience in implementing a unique model of family-centered care in a Level II nursery suggests that this model of care is beneficial to families, satisfying to health care providers, and a viable model for practice. Some basic outcome data are discussed along with suggestions for future research. Copyright © 2016 AWHONN, the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses.

Title
  Skin-to-skin contact reduces near-infrared spectroscopy pain responses in premature infants during blood sampling.
Abstract
  AIM: This study investigated if skin-to-skin contact could provide pain relief, measured with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), during venepuncture in premature infants.

   METHODS: Ten infants born at 26-35 weeks of gestation were examined during a blood-sampling procedure with venepuncture under two different conditions: in skin-to-skin contact with their mother or lying in their incubator or crib. A double-channel NIRS device was used, and oxygen saturation and heart rate were measured using pulse oximetry. The infant's face and the pulse oximetry values were videotaped throughout the procedures, so that we could carry out a pain assessment using the Premature Infant Pain Profile-Revised (PIPP-R).

   RESULTS: We found a significantly smaller increase in oxygenated haemoglobin on the contralateral side during venepuncture when the infants were in skin-to-skin contact with their mothers, compared to when they were laying in their incubator or crib. When venepuncture was compared with a sham procedure, oxygenated haemoglobin increased significantly more with the infant in the incubator or crib than held skin-to-skin, but no significant differences could be seen in the PIPP-R results between the two groups.

   CONCLUSION: This study showed that skin-to-skin contact between premature infants and their mothers during venepuncture had a pain-relieving effect. Copyright ©2015 Foundation Acta Paediatrica. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Title
  The very low birth weight infant microbiome and childhood health. [Review]
Abstract
  This review describes current understandings about the nature of the very low birth weight infant (VLBW) gut microbiome. VLBW infants often experience disruptive pregnancies and births, and prenatal factors can influence the maturity of the gut and immune system, and disturb microbial balance and succession. Many VLBWs experience rapid vaginal or Caesarean births. After birth these infants often have delays in enteral feeding, and many receive little or no mother's own milk. Furthermore the stressors of neonatal life in the hospital environment, common use of antibiotics, invasive procedures and maternal separation can contribute to dysbiosis. These infants experience gastrointestinal dysfunction, sepsis, transfusions, necrotizing enterocolitis, oxygen toxicity, and other pathophysiological conditions that affect the normal microbiota. The skin is susceptible to dysbiosis, due to its fragility and contact with NICU organisms. Dysbiosis in early life may resolve but little is known about the timing of the development of the signature gut microbiome in VLBWs. Dysbiosis has been associated with a number of physical and behavioral problems, including autism spectrum disorders, allergy and asthma, gastrointestinal disease, obesity, depression, and anxiety. Dysbiosis may be prevented or ameliorated in part by prenatal care, breast milk feeding, skin to skin contact, use of antibiotics only when necessary, and vigilance during infancy and early childhood.

Title
  Family-centered developmentally supportive care: the Swedish example.
Abstract
  The prematurely born infant is probably the most vulnerable patient in our hospitals due to the immaturity of all organ systems including the brain. Over recent years, the importance of neurodevelopmentally supportive care has been clarified. In addition, to provide the best possible treatment and environmental conditions for the vital functions of the infant to properly develop, we also must support the psychological processes of bonding and attachment between parents and their newborn infant, which is so crucial for long-term health and development. By integrating scientific findings from natural and behavioral science in multidisciplinary developmentally supportive intervention programs, recommendations for redesigning nurseries and integrating families have developed to meet these challenges. It not only is "baby- and family-friendly" but also has economic benefits and improves the long-term development of the child. The basis of family-centered developmentally supportive care interventions is the recognition that the newborn infant is a human being in his or her own right, and letting the caregivers be guided by the current needs of the individual infant and family. In this context, the Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program (NIDCAP) is unique since it is the only program designed to be implemented from the moment the infant is born. Different strategies can be used to support the nursing and medical teams to help the family become the primary caregivers of their own infants. Sweden has a long tradition of engaging parents in the actual care and of around-the-clock visiting hours. Nurseries have, or are remodeling to have, the facilities enabling parents to live in the units throughout the entire hospital stay. Skin-to-skin contact is widely implemented. In order to ensure that these strategies are in tune with the individual needs of the infant and the families, all major nurseries have trained NIDCAP professionals. Care and intervention based on the infant's own behavior makes good biological sense and is also ethically attractive. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier SAS.

Title
  Skin-to-Skin Contact: A Comforting Place With Comfort Food.
Abstract
  Birth and the newborn environment are stressful, especially for preterm infants who have to contend with medical conditions while adapting to the extrauterine world. Therefore, preterm newborns are excellent candidates for comforting measures. Skin-to-skin contact is the best way to provide comfort in several of the realms of Kolcaba's Comfort Theory. Evidence suggests that skin-to-skin contact between the mother and newborn changes the discomforting newborn environment into one that is profoundly comforting. Skin-to-skin contact promotes infant physiologic stability and warmth, helps in organizing infant sleep, reduces stress and pain, and makes breast milk readily available. Comfort to the newborn can be effectively accomplished by skin-to-skin contact.

  Postnatal changes in skin water content in preterm infants.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Preterm infants have immature skin, which contributes to skin problems. Very little is known about postnatal changes in the skin, despite the clinical importance of this issue.

   AIM: To assess temporal changes in skin water content in preterm infants.

   STUDY DESIGN: A prospective observational study.

   SUBJECTS: Infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit were included in this study.

   OUTCOME MEASURES: Skin water content was measured at five different skin regions using dielectric methods at a depth of 1.5mm. Skin water content was measured on postnatal day 1 in 101 infants, and the correlation between skin water content and gestational week was analyzed. Measurements were also made on postnatal days 2, 3, and 7, and every 7days thereafter until the corrected age of 37weeks in 87 of the 101 infants. Temporal changes were statistically analyzed after dividing participants into seven groups by gestational age.

   RESULTS: On postnatal day 1, skin water content correlated inversely with gestational age at all skin regions. Skin water content decreased significantly over time, converging to the level of term infants by the corrected age of 32-35weeks.

   CONCLUSIONS: Skin water content at a depth of 1.5mm was related to corrected age and reached the level of term infants by the corrected age of approximately 32-35weeks. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title
  Family nurture intervention improves the quality of maternal caregiving in the neonatal intensive care unit: evidence from a randomized controlled trial.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the impact of Family Nurture Intervention (FNI) on the quality of maternal caregiving behavior (MCB) while in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). FNI is a randomized controlled trial conducted in a high-acuity NICU to facilitate an emotional connection between mothers and their premature infants. FNI begins shortly after birth, continues until discharge, and involves mother/infant calming sessions that include scent cloth exchange, vocal soothing and emotion expression, eye contact, skin-to-skin and clothed holding, and family-based support sessions.

   METHODS: Maternal caregiving behavior was coded during a single holding and feeding session (~30 min) in the NICU before discharge at approximately 36 weeks gestational age (GA). Sixty-five mothers and their premature infants (34 male, 31 female; 26-34 wk GA) were included in these analyses (FNI, n = 35; standard care [SC], n = 30).

   RESULTS: Relative to mothers in the SC condition, those in the FNI group showed significantly higher quality MCB, which remained significant when controlling for birth order, twin status, maternal depression, and maternal anxiety.

   CONCLUSION: This is the first study to demonstrate that in-unit MCB can be enhanced by a hospital-based intervention. FNI provides a new rationale for integrating nurture-based interventions into standard NICU care.

Title
  A Case Study of Infant Physiologic Response to Skin-to-Skin Contact After Surgery for Complex Congenital Heart Disease.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Infants with complex congenital heart disease requiring surgical intervention within the first days or weeks of life may be the most seriously ill infants needing intensive nursing and medical care. Skin-to-skin contact (SSC) is well accepted and practiced as a positive therapeutic intervention in premature infants but is not routinely offered to infants in cardiac intensive care units. The physiologic effects of SSC in the congenital heart disease population must be examined before recommending incorporation of SSC into standard care routines.

   OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this case study was to describe the physiologic response to a single session of SSC in an 18-day-old infant with hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

   METHODS: Repeated measures of heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and temperature were recorded 30 minutes before SSC, during SSC (including interruptions for bottle and breast feedings), and 10 minutes after SSC was completed.

   RESULTS: All physiologic parameters were clinically acceptable throughout the 135-minute observation.

   CONCLUSION: This case study provides beginning evidence that SSC is safe in full-term infants after surgery for complex congenital heart disease. Further research with a larger sample is needed to examine the effects of SSC on infant physiology before surgery and earlier in the postoperative time period as well as on additional outcomes such as length of stay, maternal-infant interaction, and neurodevelopment.

Title
  Use of opportunistic clinical data and a population pharmacokinetic model to support dosing of clindamycin for premature infants to adolescents.
Abstract
  Clindamycin is commonly prescribed to treat children with skin and skin-structure infections (including those caused by community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA)), yet little is known about its pharmacokinetics (PK) across pediatric age groups. A population PK analysis was performed in NONMEM using samples collected in an opportunistic study from children receiving i.v. clindamycin per standard of care. The final model was used to optimize pediatric dosing to match adult exposure proven effective against CA-MRSA. A total of 194 plasma PK samples collected from 125 children were included in the analysis. A one-compartment model described the data well. The final model included body weight and a sigmoidal maturation relationship between postmenstrual age (PMA) and clearance (CL): CL (l/h) = 13.7 x (weight/70)(0.75) x (PMA(3.1)/(43.6(3.1) + PMA(3.1))); V (l) = 61.8 x (weight/70). Maturation reached 50% of adult CL values at ~44 weeks PMA. Our findings support age-based dosing.

Title
  Trends in care practices reflecting parental involvement in neonatal care.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Everyday care practices can facilitate or hinder parents' participation and involvement in neonatal care.

   AIMS: To evaluate trends in family-centered care practices in the Neonatal Intensive Care unit in Turku University Hospital.

   STUDY DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: In this retrospective study, the patient charts of very preterm infants were reviewed in 4 cohorts: 2001 to 2002 (n=72), 2006 to 2007 (n=69), 2009 to 2010 (n=76), and 2011 to 2012 (n=78).

   OUTCOME MEASURES: Care practices with parental involvement were evaluated: 1) thermoregulation; 2) nutrition and feeding; 3) the beginning and number of skin-to-skin care episodes. As safety measures, the length of stay and weight gain were recorded at discharge.

   RESULTS: The significant trends included: a decrease in gestational age at the end of incubator care (mean 33.4 [standard deviation (SD) 1.36] to 31.6 [SD 1.1], p<0.001) and at the beginning of breast-feeding (35.3 [SD 1.34] to 33.1 [SD 1.89], p<0.001), bottle feeding (from 34.1 [SD 1.04] to 33.3 [SD 1.51], p=0.003) and skin-to-skin care (from 32.8 [SD 1.99] to 29.9 [SD 2.34], p<0.001). The changes were most remarkable in the infants below 28 weeks. In addition, weight gain increased from 110 g to 159 g per week (p<0.001).

   CONCLUSIONS: The hospital care practices of very preterm infants developed during the study period support parental involvement. During the same time period, the weight gain of very preterm infants improved, significantly. These practices can serve as indicators of progressive trends in family centered care.

Title
  Procedural pain in neonatal units in Kenya.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: To determine the nature and frequency of painful procedures and procedural pain management practices in neonatal units in Kenya.

   DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey.

   SETTING: Level I and level II neonatal units in Kenya.

   PATIENTS: Ninety-five term and preterm neonates from seven neonatal units.

   METHODS: Medical records of neonates admitted for at least 24 h were reviewed to determine the nature and frequency of painful procedures performed in the 24 h period preceding data collection (6:00 to 6:00) as well as the pain management interventions (eg, morphine, breastfeeding, skin-to-skin contact, containment, non-nutritive sucking) that accompanied each procedure.

   RESULTS: Neonates experienced a total of 404 painful procedures over a 24 h period (mean=4.3, SD 2.0; range 1-12); 270 tissue-damaging (mean=2.85, SD 1.1; range 1-6) and 134 non-tissue-damaging procedures (mean=1.41, SD 1.2; range 0-6). Peripheral cannula insertion (27%) and intramuscular injections (22%) were the most common painful procedures. Ventilated neonates and neonates admitted in level II neonatal units had a higher number of painful procedures than those admitted in level I units (mean 4.76 vs 2.96). Only one procedure had a pain intensity score documented; and none had been performed with any form of analgesia.

   CONCLUSIONS: Neonates in Kenya were exposed to numerous tissue-damaging and non-tissue-damaging procedures without any form of analgesia. Our findings suggest that education is needed on how to assess and manage procedural pain in neonatal units in Kenya. Copyright Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Title
  Local understandings of care during delivery and postnatal period to inform home based package of newborn care interventions in rural Ethiopia: a qualitative study.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Despite a substantial decrease in child mortality in Ethiopia over the past decade, neonatal mortality remains unchanged (37/1000 live-births). This paper describes a qualitative study on beliefs and practices on immediate newborn and postnatal care in four rural communities of Ethiopia conducted to inform development of a package of community-based interventions targeting newborns.

   METHODS: The study team conducted eight key informant interviews (KII) with grandmothers, 27 in-depth interviews (IDI) with mothers; seven IDI with traditional birth attendants (TBA) and 15IDI with fathers, from four purposively selected communities located in Sidama Zone of Southern Nationalities, Nations, and Peoples (SNNP) Region and in East Shewa and West Arsi Zones of Oromia Region.

   RESULTS: In the study communities deliveries occurred at home. After cutting the umbilical cord, the baby is put to the side of the mother, not uncommonly with no cloth covering. This is largely due to attendants focusing on delivery of the placenta which is reinforced by the belief that the placenta is the 'house' or 'blanket' of the baby and that any "harm" caused to the placenta will transfer to the newborn. Applying butter or ointment to the cord "to speed drying" is common practice. Initiation of breastfeeding is often delayed and women commonly report discarding colostrum before initiating breastfeeding. Sub-optimal breastfeeding practices continue, due to perceived inadequate maternal nutrition and breast milk often leading to the provision of herbal drinks. Poor thermal care is also demonstrated through lack of continued skin-to-skin contact, exposure of newborns to smoke, frequent bathing-often with cold water baths for low-birth weight or small babies; and, poor hygienic practices are reported, particularly hand washing prior to contact with the newborn.

   CONCLUSION: Cultural beliefs and newborn care practices do not conform to recommended standards. Local perspectives related to newborn care practices should inform behaviour change messages. Such messages should target mothers, grandmothers, TBAs, other female family members and fathers.

Title
  Subpericranial shunt valve placement: a technique in patients with friable skin.
Abstract
  INTRODUCTION: One of the nightmares of placing a shunt in patients with friable skin is an exposed shunt or shunt valve with risk of infection of the hardware which may lead to meningitis or ventriculitis with poor outcome. Another feared complication is cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak from the wound with subsequent wound dehiscence. The patients at risk of shunt hardware exposure include children who have fragile skin or skin at risk (either from prematurity, malnutrition, steroid therapy or very large head with pressure on the skin).

   METHOD/TECHNIQUE: This technique involves making a scalp incision with the pericranium taken in one layer with the galea or if the galeal flap has been raised, a pericranial incision is made and a pericranial flap is raised. A subpericranial pouch is developed and a shunt passer used to tunnel the shunt to the abdomen. The pericranial layer is closed, the galea and subcutaneous layer also approximated, and a continuous subcurticular stitch applied.

   RESULT: We present a malnourished infant with postinfective hydrocephalus having a thin skin requiring a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. A subpericranial technique was used and the patient did well.

   CONCLUSION: This technique is simple and provides a water-tight wound cover, with the pericranium giving reinforcement and better tensile strength, as well as a fairly good protection for the shunt valve. This is useful in preventing CSF leaks and exposure of the shunt with the associated morbidity and mortality.

Title
  Effect of early skin-to-skin contact following normal delivery on incidence of hypothermia in neonates more than 1800 g: randomized control trial.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of early skin-to-skin contact (SSC) provided for first 24 h on incidence of hypothermia in stable newborns weighing 1800 g or more during first 48 h of life.

   STUDY DESIGN: Stable newborns (term and late preterm: Mean gestational age 37.7 (1.35) weeks, range 34-40 weeks) having birth weight 1800 g or more (Mean weight 2605.6 (419.8) grams) were enrolled after approval from Institutional Human Research Ethics Committee (CTRI/2013/06/003790) and randomized into early SSC (intervention group) and conventional care (control group). Initial care in the delivery room for few minutes immediately after birth in both the groups was given under radiant warmer. In the intervention group, newborns were provided SSC by their mother started between 30 min and 1 h after birth for first 24 h with minimal interruption and were provided conventional care other than SSC for next 24 h of life. In the control group, newborns were kept with their mother and received conventional care other than SSC for first 48 h. Temperature and heart rate of newborns were recorded at 30 min, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 24 and at 48 h of life in both the groups. Independent Samples t-Test and relative risk were used to analyze the data.

   RESULT: Both groups had 50 neonates each with similar baseline characteristics. Heart rates were in normal range in both the groups. The intervention group provided an average (s.d.) of 16.98 (0.28) h of SSC over the first 24 h period. The mean temperature was significantly high in the SSC group at all time intervals starting from 1 to 48 h (P<0.05 for all). In the SSC group only two newborns (4%) had mild hypothermia (cold stress), and, of these two newborns, one had two episodes of hypothermia. All these three episodes of hypothermia occurred within first 3 h of life. In the control group 16 newborns (32%) developed hypothermia (temperature<36.5 degreeC) during first 48 h of life. Of them, 11 newborns had single episode, 4 newborns had two episodes and one newborn had three episodes of hypothermia. Of these 22 hypothermic episodes, 20 occurred in the first 6 h of life and 2 episodes occurred at 48 h of life. Moderate hypothermia was seen in two newborns, whereas rest had mild hypothermia. The relative risk of developing hypothermia in the control group as compared with the SSC group was 8.00 (95% CI 1.94-32.99). There was no seasonal variation in incidence of hypothermia in both the groups.

   CONCLUSION: Newborns in the SSC group achieved rapid thermal control as compared with the control group. Early SSC for 24 h after birth decreases incidence of hypothermia for initial 48 h of life. Early SSC needs to be aggressively promoted in term and late-preterm newborns to reduce incidence of hypothermia.

Title
  Randomized controlled trial of Family Nurture Intervention in the NICU: assessments of length of stay, feasibility and safety.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: While survival rates for preterm infants have increased, the risk for adverse long-term neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes remains very high. In response to the need for novel, evidence-based interventions that prevent such outcomes, we have assessed Family Nurture Intervention (FNI), a novel dual mother-infant intervention implemented while the infant is in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Here, we report the first trial results, including the primary outcome measure, length of stay in the NICU and, the feasibility and safety of its implementation in a high acuity level IV NICU.

   METHODS: The FNI trial is a single center, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial at Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital for mothers and their singleton or twin infants of 26-34 weeks gestation. Families were randomized to standard care (SC) or (FNI). FNI was implemented by nurture specialists trained to facilitate affective communication between mother and infant during specified calming interactions. These interactions included scent cloth exchange, sustained touch, vocal soothing and eye contact, wrapped or skin-to-skin holding, plus family-based support interactions.

   RESULTS: A total of 826 infants born between 26 and 34 weeks during the 3.5 year study period were admitted to the NICU. After infant and mother screening plus exclusion due to circumstances that prevented the family from participating, 373 infants were eligible for the study. Of these, we were unable to schedule a consent meeting with 56, and consent was withheld by 165. Consent was obtained for 150 infants from 115 families. The infants were block randomized to groups of N = 78, FNI and N = 72, SC. Sixteen (9.6%) of the randomized infants did not complete the study to home discharge, 7% of those randomized to SC and 12% of FNI infants. Mothers in the intervention group engaged in 3 to 4 facilitated one- to two-hour sessions/week. Intent to treat analyses revealed no significant difference between groups in medical complications. The mean length of stay was not significantly affected by the intervention.

   CONCLUSION: There was no significant effect demonstrated with this intervention amount on the primary short-term outcome, length of stay. FNI can be safely and feasibly implemented within a level IV NICU.

Title
  Importance of maintaining the newly born temperature in the normal range from delivery to admission. [Review]
Abstract
  Over the last 50 years an increasing amount of evidence on neonatal resuscitation and stabilisation practices has led to written recommendations on all aspects of newborn care in the first few minutes of life. Much evidence for thermoregulatory management of both term and preterm infants has existed for decades and more recently research has identified new techniques to maintain normothermia in newly born infants. The use of increased environmental temperatures, skin-to-skin care, radiant warmers, plastic coverings and hats, exothermic mattresses and heated humidified gases have or are undergoing evaluation. However, despite the apparent acceptance of these techniques, a substantial number of infants continue to become hypothermic soon after delivery, leading to an increased risk of comorbidities and of death. Gaps in our knowledge remain and further research opportunities are available. However, we must also ensure that established thermoregulatory methods for which the evidence already exists are given as much emphasis as other aspects of newborn care and are implemented meticulously in all healthcare settings.

Title
  Safety and effectiveness of skin-to-skin contact in the NICU to support neurodevelopment in vulnerable preterm infants.
Abstract
  Skin-to-skin contact (SSC) is a cornerstone of neurodevelopmentally supportive and family-oriented care for very low-birth-weight preterm infants (VPIs). However, performing SSC with unstable and/or ventilated VPIs remains challenging for caregiving teams and/or controversial in the literature. We first aimed to assess the safety and effectiveness of SSC with vulnerable VPIs in a neonatal intensive care unit over 12 months. Our second aim was to evaluate the impact of the respiratory support (intubation or not) and of the infant's weight (above or below 1000 g) on the effects of SSC. Vital signs, body temperature, and oxygen requirement data were prospectively recorded by each infant's nurse before (baseline), during (3 time points), and after their first or first 2 SSC episodes. We compared the variations of each parameter from baseline (analysis of variance for repeated measures with post hoc analysis when appropriate). We studied 141 SSCs in 96 VPIs of 28 (24-33) weeks' gestational age, at 12 (0-55) days of postnatal age, and at a postmenstrual age of 30.5 (+/-1.5) weeks. During SSC, there were statistically significant increases in oxygen saturation (Sao2) (P < .001) with decreases in oxygen requirement (P = .043), a decrease in heart rate toward stability (P < .01) but a transient and moderate decrease in mean axillary temperature following the transfer from bed to mother (P < .05). Apneas/bradycardias requiring minor intervention occurred in 19 (13%) SSCs, without need for SSC termination. These variations were similar for intubated newborns (18%) as compared with newborns on nasal continuous positive airway pressure (52%) or breathing room air (30%). However, ventilated infants exhibited a significant increase in transcutaneous partial pressure of carbon dioxide (TcPco2) (P = .01), although remaining in a clinically acceptable range, and a greater decrease in oxygen requirements during SSC (P < .001) than nonventilated infants. Skin-to-skin contact in the neonatal intensive care unit seems safe and effective even in ventilated VPIs. Recording physiologic data of infants before, during, and after SCC provides data needed to secure changes of practice in SCC.

Title
  Randomized trial comparing the effectiveness of 2 electric breast pumps in the NICU.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Mothers with preterm infants may need to express milk for considerable periods. Research to improve breast pump design has focused on compression stimuli, frequencies, and vacuums.

   OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of 2 electric pumps: Medela Symphony (pump S) and a novel pump (Philips AVENT Twin electronic pump; pump A). Both offer flexibility of rate and suction; pump A also incorporates petal compression cushions. Primary outcomes were (1) milk weight expressed during 10-day study period and (2) weight of milk expressed in a 15-minute test.

   METHODS: Seventy-one mothers with preterm infants < 34 weeks were randomized. Mothers completed 10-day diaries including weight of milk expressed. Milk weight expressed during a single 15-minute test period and data on pumping mode, skin-to-skin contact, breastfeeding at infant discharge, and mothers' opinions of the pump were recorded.

   RESULTS: There was no significant difference in milk expressed during the first 10 days between groups. Pump S mothers expressed significantly more milk during a fixed 15-minute period. Mothers using pump A awarded higher scores for certain characteristics of the pump, notably location of control button and ease of use. Similar proportions of infants received breast milk at discharge, but pump A mothers were more likely to be directly breastfeeding (odds ratio, 4.27 [95% confidence interval, 1.29, 14.1]).

   CONCLUSION: The breast pumps showed similar effectiveness in terms of milk expression and maternal opinions. The finding that breast pump design may influence breastfeeding at infant discharge merits further investigation.

Title
  Evidence-based thermal care of low birthweight neonates. Part two: family-centred care principles.
Abstract
  Parents should be involved in the care of, and decision making for, their newborn, and separations should be minimised. Their needs should be anticipated, respected and catered for in the neonatal unit. Open, clear, consistent information and communication should be maintained. Recommended facilities include accommodation and equipment for expressing breast milk, 24-hour visiting, psychological support services and maximised opportunities for parents to provide positive, gentle touch and skin-to-skin contact with their child during the admission.

Title
  Expanded care for women and families after preterm birth.
Abstract
  Prematurity is a complication of pregnancy for 1 in 8 families in the United States. The focus of care after preterm birth shifts to the fragile newborn, while the needs of the woman and her family may be overlooked. There are many challenges for parents, including impaired parent-newborn attachment, difficulties with breastfeeding, postpartum mental health, and family disruption. Premature birth may even risk the developing relationship between parents and their child. Comprehensive care is recommended for parents who have experienced a preterm birth, including support of effective lactation, promotion of skin-to-skin care, reflection on the birth experience, support and evaluation of postpartum mental health, and provision of family-centered care. Preconception care after preterm birth needs to include guidance about the recurrence risk for preterm birth as well as recommendations for risk reduction.

Title
  Nutritional requirements and feeding recommendations for small for gestational age infants.
Abstract
  We define the small for gestational age (SGA) infant as an infant born >= 35 weeks' gestation and <10th percentile on the Fenton Growth Chart. Policy statements from many organizations recommend mother's own milk for SGA infants because it meets most of their nutritional requirements and provides short- and long-term benefits. Several distinct patterns of intrauterine growth restriction are identified among the heterogeneous grouping of SGA infants; each varies with regard to neonatal morbidities, requirements for neonatal management, postnatal growth velocities, neurodevelopmental progress, and adult health outcomes. There is much we do not know about nutritional management of the SGA infant. We need to identify and define: infants who have "true" growth restriction and are at high risk for adverse metabolic outcomes in later life; optimal growth velocity and "catch-up" growth rates that are conducive with life-long health and well being; global approaches to management of hypoglycemia; and an optimal model for postdischarge care. Large, rigorously conducted trials are required to determine whether aggressive feeding of SGA infants results in improved nutritional rehabilitation, growth, and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Before birth, maternal supplementation with specific nutrients reduces the rate and severity of growth restriction and may prevent nutrient deficiency states if infants are born SGA. After birth, the generally accepted goal is to provide enough nutrients to achieve postnatal growth similar to that of a normal fetus. In addition, we recommend SGA infants be allowed to "room in" with their mothers to promote breastfeeding, mother-infant attachment, and skin-to-skin contact to assist with thermoregulation.

Title
  The global burden of neonatal hypothermia: systematic review of a major challenge for newborn survival.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: To provide evidence on the global epidemiological situation of neonatal hypothermia and to provide recommendations for future policy and research directions.

   METHODS: Using PubMed as our principal electronic reference library, we searched studies for prevalence and risk factor data on neonatal hypothermia in resource-limited environments globally. Studies specifying study location, setting (hospital or community based), sample size, case definition of body temperature for hypothermia, temperature measurement method, and point estimates for hypothermia prevalence were eligible for inclusion.

   RESULTS: Hypothermia is common in infants born at hospitals (prevalence range, 32% to 85%) and homes (prevalence range, 11% to 92%), even in tropical environments. The lack of thermal protection is still an underappreciated major challenge for newborn survival in developing countries. Although hypothermia is rarely a direct cause of death, it contributes to a substantial proportion of neonatal mortality globally, mostly as a comorbidity of severe neonatal infections, preterm birth, and asphyxia. Thresholds for the definition of hypothermia vary, and data on its prevalence in neonates is scarce, particularly on a community level in Africa.

   CONCLUSIONS: A standardized approach to the collection and analysis of hypothermia data in existing newborn programs and studies is needed to inform policy and program planners on optimal thermal protection interventions. Thermoprotective behavior changes such as skin-to-skin care or the use of appropriate devices have not yet been scaled up globally. The introduction of simple hypothermia prevention messages and interventions into evidence-based, cost-effective packages for maternal and newborn care has promising potential to decrease the heavy global burden of newborn deaths attributable to severe infections, prematurity, and asphyxia. Because preventing and treating newborn hypothermia in health institutions and communities is relatively easy, addressing this widespread challenge might play a substantial role in reaching Millennium Development Goal 4, a reduction of child mortality.

Title
  Initiation and extent of skin-to-skin care at two Swedish neonatal intensive care units.
Abstract
  AIM: To describe initiation and extent of parents' application of skin-to-skin care (SSC) with their preterm infants at two Swedish neonatal intensive care units.

   METHODS: The duration of SSC was recorded in 104 infants' medical charts during their hospital stay, and the parents answered a questionnaire.

   RESULTS: Both parents were involved in the practice of SSC. Three infants experienced SSC directly after birth, 34 within 1 h, 85 within 24 h and the remaining 19 at 24-78 h postbirth. SSC commenced earlier (median age of 50 min) in infants whose first SSC was with their father instead of with their mother (median age of 649 min: p < 0.001). The earlier the SSC was initiated, the longer the infant was cared for skin-to-skin per day during his/her hospital stay (p < 0.001). The median daily duration of SSC was 403 min.

   CONCLUSION: Early initiation of SSC had positive impact on the extent of parents' application of SSC. Even though the infants in this study were cared for skin-to-skin to a high extent, there is a potential for extended use of SSC in this type of hospital setting for reducing separation between infants and parents.

Title
  Neonatal intensive care practices and the influence on skin condition.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Premature skin has a thinner epidermis with a poorly formed stratum corneum (SC) barrier compared to full term skin. Poor skin integrity increases the risk of exposure to irritants and infectious agents. Interventions that facilitate skin maturation are essential.

   OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the effects of prematurity and time from birth on SC maturation and to identify factors that impact skin condition.

   METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted among 130 NICU patients. Skin regions were evaluated for erythema, rash, integrity and function. The effects of gestational age, time from birth, stool exposure, nutrition and diagnosis were examined.

   RESULTS: Three groups emerged: (i) premature and <38 weeks adjusted age; (ii) premature and >38 weeks adjusted age; and (iii) full term. Surprisingly, the premature infants exhibited lower perineal irritation and greater SC integrity (lower transepidermal water loss) than full terms (P < 0.05). Group 2 had a longer time before the first skin-stool contact. Chest skin pH showed maturational changes for Group 1 (P < 0.05) but did not change for premature Group 2 who was older at enrollment. Erythema was lower for infants using elemental formulas or total parenteral nutrition.

   CONCLUSIONS: Premature infants with early stool contact and high exposure, full term infants, and patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia or trisomy 21 are at high risk for skin compromise and may benefit from prophylactic interventions to minimize compromise. Low stool exposure and greater time before the first stool contact appear to be protective against skin compromise. Copyright © 2012 The Authors.

Title
  Salivary Cortisol as a Biomarker of Stress in Mothers and their Low Birth Weight Infants and Sample Collecting Challenges.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Salivary cortisol measurement is a non-invasive method suitable for use in neonatal research. Mother-infant separation after birth represents stress and skin-to-skin contact (SSC) has numerous benefits. The aim of the study was to measure salivary cortisol in mothers and newborns before and after SSC in order to assess the effect of SSC on mothers' and infants' stress and to estimate the efficacy of collecting small saliva samples in newborns.

   METHODS: Salivary cortisol was measured in 35 mother-infant pairs before and after the first and the fifth SSC in small saliva samples (50 muL) using the high sensitivity Quantitative ELISA-Kit (0.0828 nmol/L) for low cortisol levels detection. Samples were collected with eye sponge during 3 to 5 minutes.

   RESULTS: Cortisol level in mothers decreased after SSC: the highest levels were measured before and the lowest after SSC and the differences in values were significant during both the first (p<0.001) and the fifth SSC (p<0.001). During the first SSC the cortisol level decrease was detected in 14 (40%) and an increase in 21 (60%) newborns, and during the fifth SSC a decrease was detected in 16 (45.7%) and an increase in 19 (54.3%) newborns, without confirmed significance of the difference. Saliva sampling efficacy using eye sponge was 75%.

   CONCLUSIONS: Cortisol level decrease in mothers proves the stress reduction during SSC, while variable cortisol levels in infants do not indicate stress reduction and imply the need for further research. The used sampling method appeared to be one of the most optimal considering the sample volume, sampling time and efficacy.

Title
  Effectiveness of the professional who carries out the health education program: perinatal outcomes.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine whether a maternal education program conducted by midwives achieves better results in regard to maternal and newborn health than when the program is conducted by other health professionals.

   METHODS: Five hundred and twenty primiparous women attending four (two university) public hospitals in southern Spain in 2011 were recruited to participate in this prospective cohort study. Data on sociodemographic and obstetric variables and characteristics of newborns were collected by interviews and from clinical charts. Crude and logistic regression adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated.

   RESULTS: A midwife was in charge of education for 75.4% of the 354 women who attended maternal education programs. Midwife-conducted programs had significantly more women attending more than three sessions than the programs conducted by other health professionals (aOR 2.85, 95% CI 1.60-5.11). Midwives achieved more active participation from mothers during delivery (aOR 1.96, 95% CI 1.15-3.33), more early skin-to-skin contact between the mother and newborn (aOR 1.79, 95% CI 1.01-3.23), more early breastfeeding (aOR 2.08, 95% CI 1.18-3.70), and fewer newborns with low birth weight (aOR 0.14, 95% CI 0.03-0.65) compared with other health professionals.

   CONCLUSION: Midwives achieve better results than other health professionals in regard to the health of the mother and her newborn when they are in charge of the maternal education program.

  [Breast feeding in premature babies: development-centered care in Palestine]. [Spanish]
Abstract
  UNLABELLED: In addition to its important role in the initiation of breastfeeding, early skin-to-skin contact benefits both mothers and their babies.

   OBJECTIVE: To inform all mothers of premature babies about the importance of skin-to-skin contact and breast-feeding in order to foment a closer bond between mother and child (development-centered care).

   MATERIALS AND METHOD: A prospective cohort study was conducted in various hospitals on the West Bank in Palestine during 2008-2011. The universe was made up of an estimated average of 2,500 childbirths per year in each hospital. All of the subjects in the sample population of n = 252 babies had a gestational age of less than 37 GWs, and had weighed less than 2,500 grams at birth. For health reasons, they were hospitalized in neonatal care units.

   RESULTS: The results obtained showed that in Palestine, young women tend to breastfeed their babies and have skin-to-skin contact with them more often than older mothers. Once the new mothers were informed of the advantages of these practices, they showed greater interest in learning how to care for their babies in the neonatal care units.

   CONCLUSIONS: Breastfeeding premature babies as well as having skin-to-skin contact with them was made possible by informing and teaching new mothers about the advantages of this type of infant care. This research has had widespread impact and has been very well received by the female population in the country. This is the first study of its kind to be carried out in Palestine.

Title
  [Clinical features of Candida albicans sepsis in preterm infants: an analysis of 13 cases]. [Chinese]
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical features of Candida albicans sepsis in preterm infants.

   METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical data of 13 preterm infants with Candida albicans sepsis, who were born at 28 to 36 weeks of gestational age and who weighed between 1400 and 2815 g.

   RESULTS: The infants were infected with Candida albicans at the age of 19+/-11 d, with the main clinical manifestations being apnea, poor response, poor skin perfusion, blood oxygen concentration decrease, dark skin, yellowish skin, heart rate increase in the rest state, copious phlegm and difficulty in weaning from the ventilator. The infants showed significantly decreased platelet and increased C-reactive protein (CRP), platelet distribution width (PDW), alanine transaminase (ALT), creatine kinase isoenzyme-MB (CK-MB), total bilirubin (TBIL), creatine kinase (CK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). CK and LDH were significantly decreased after 2 weeks of antifungal therapy. Only 3 cases developed drug resistance to fluconazole and these showed response when treated with voriconazole instead. Of the 13 cases, 10 were cured, 2 abandoned therapy and 1 died.

   CONCLUSIONS: The clinical manifestations of Candida albicans sepsis are nonspecific in preterm infants. Infectious diseases are probably caused by Candida albicans in preterm infants 2-3 weeks after birth. Preterm infants show decreased platelet and increased CRP, PDW, ALT, CK-MB, TBIL, CK, and LDH when infected with Candida albicans.

Title
  Rethinking placental transfusion and cord clamping issues. [Review]
Abstract
  A brief delay in clamping the umbilical cord results in a placental transfusion that supplies the infant with a major source of iron during the first few months of life. Cord circulation continues for several minutes after birth and placental transfusion results in approximately 30% more blood volume. Gravity influences the amount of placental transfusion that an infant receives. Placing the infant skin-to-skin requires a longer delay of cord clamping (DCC) than current recommendations. Uterotonics are not contraindicated with DCC. Cord milking is a safe alternative to DCC when one must cut the cord prematurely. Recent randomized controlled trials demonstrate benefits for term and preterm infants from DCC. The belief that DCC causes hyperbilirubinemia or symptomatic polycythemia is unsupported by the available research. Delay of cord clamping substantively increases iron stores in early infancy. Inadequate iron stores in infancy may have an irreversible impact on the developing brain despite oral iron supplementation. Iron deficiency in infancy can lead to neurologic issues in older children including poor school performance, decreased cognitive abilities, and behavioral problems. The management of the umbilical cord in complex situations is inconsistent between birth settings. A change in practice requires collaboration between all types of providers who attend births.

Title
  Breastfeeding support in neonatal intensive care: a national survey.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The incidence of breastfeeding of preterm infants is affected by the support provided at the hospital and in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). However, policies and guidelines promoting breastfeeding vary both nationally and internationally.

   OBJECTIVES: The aim of this survey was to describe breastfeeding support in Danish NICUs, where approximately 98% of mothers initiate lactation.

   METHODS: A national survey of all 19 Danish NICUs was conducted in 2009. Four NICUs were at designated Baby-Friendly hospitals, and 5 had a lactation consultant. In all NICUs, it was possible for some parents to stay overnight; 2 units had short restrictions on parents' presence. Five NICUs had integrated postpartum care for mothers. Breastfeeding policies, written guidelines, and systematic breastfeeding training for the staff were common in most NICUs. Seventeen NICUs recommended starting breast milk expression within 6 hours after birth, and mothers were encouraged to double pump. Most NICUs aimed to initiate skin-to-skin contact the first time the parents were in the NICU, and daily skin-to-skin contact was estimated to last for 2-4 hours in 63% and 4-8 hours in 37% of the units. The use of bottle-feeding was restricted.

   CONCLUSIONS: The Danish NICUs described the support of breastfeeding as a high priority, which was reflected in the recommended policies for breast milk pumping, skin-to-skin contact, and the parents' presence in the NICU, as well as in the restricted use of bottle-feeding. However, support varied between units, and not all units supported optimal breastfeeding.

Title
  Breast milk and glucose for pain relief in preterm infants: a noninferiority randomized controlled trial.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: The study goal was to compare the efficacy of expressed breast milk (EBM) versus 25% glucose on pain responses of late preterm infants during heel lancing.

   METHODS: In a noninferiority randomized controlled trial, a total of 113 newborns were randomized to receive EBM (experimental group [EG]) or 25% glucose (control group [CG]) before undergoing heel lancing. The primary outcome was pain intensity (Premature Infant Pain Profile [PIPP]) and a 10% noninferiority margin was established. Secondary outcomes were incidence of cry and percentage of time spent crying and adverse events. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was used.

   RESULTS: Groups were similar regarding demographics and clinical characteristics, except for birth weight and weight at data collection day. There were lower pain scores in the CG over 3 minutes after lancing (P < .001). A higher number of infants in the CG had PIPP scores indicative of minimal pain or absence of pain (P = .002 and P = .003 on ITT analysis) at 30 seconds after lancing, and the mean difference in PIPP scores was 3 (95% confidence interval: 1.507-4.483). Lower incidence of cry (P = .001) and shorter duration of crying (P = .014) were observed for CG. Adverse events were benign and self-limited, and there was no significant difference between groups (P = .736 and P = .637 on ITT analysis).

   CONCLUSIONS: Results based on PIPP scores and crying time indicate poorer effects of EBM compared with 25% glucose during heel lancing. Additional studies exploring the vol and administration of EBM and its combination with other strategies such as skin-to-skin contact and sucking are necessary.

Title
  Thermal protection of the newborn in resource-limited environments. [Review]
Abstract
  Appropriate thermal protection of the newborn prevents hypothermia and its associated burden of morbidity and mortality. Yet, current global birth practices tend to not adequately address this challenge. Here, we discuss the pathophysiology of hypothermia in the newborn, its prevention and therapeutic options with particular attention to resource-limited environments. Newborns are equipped with sophisticated mechanisms of body temperature regulation. Neonatal thermoregulation is a critical function for newborn survival, regulated in the hypothalamus and mediated by endocrine pathways. Hypothermia activates cellular metabolism through shivering and non-shivering thermogenesis. In newborns, optimal temperature ranges are narrow and thermoregulatory mechanisms easily overwhelmed, particularly in premature and low-birth weight infants. Hyperthermia most commonly is associated with dehydration and potentially sepsis. The lack of thermal protection promptly leads to hypothermia, which is associated with detrimental metabolic and other pathophysiological processes. Simple thermal protection strategies are feasible at community and institutional levels in resource-limited environments. Appropriate interventions include skin-to-skin care, breastfeeding and protective clothing or devices. Due to poor provider training and limited awareness of the problem, appropriate thermal care of the newborn is often neglected in many settings. Education and appropriate devices might foster improved hypothermia management through mothers, birth attendants and health care workers. Integration of relatively simple thermal protection interventions into existing mother and child health programs can effectively prevent newborn hypothermia even in resource-limited environments.

Title
  Clinician perspectives on barriers to and opportunities for skin-to-skin contact for premature infants in neonatal intensive care units.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to investigate key factors in promoting skin-to-skin contact (STSC) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).

   METHODS: As part of a California Perinatal Quality Care Collaborative on improving nutrition and promoting breastmilk feeding of premature infants, a multidisciplinary group of representatives from 11 hospitals discussed the progress and barriers in pursuing the project. A key component of the collaborative project was promotion of STSC. Sessions were audio-recorded, transcribed, and assessed using qualitative research methods with the aid of Atlas Ti software (ATLAS.ti Scientific Software Development GmbH, Berlin, Germany). Two primary investigators studied the transcripts for themes related to STSC. Using an iterative approach, selected themes were explored, and representative quotes were selected.

   RESULTS: Barriers to promoting STSC fell into broad themes of implementation, institutional, and familial factors. The main challenge identified in implementation was defining a clinically stable eligible population of patients. Key institutional factors were education and motivation of staff. Familial factors involved facilitation and sustained motivation of mothers. In response to these barriers, opportunities for promoting STSC were enacted or suggested by the group, including defining clinical stability for eligibility, facilitating documentation, strategies to increase parent and staff education and motivation, and encouraging maternal visitation and comfort.

   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings may be useful for institutions seeking to develop policies and strategies to increase STSC and breastmilk feeding in their NICUs.

Title
  The relation between early mother-infant skin-to-skin contact and later maternal sensitivity in South African mothers of low birth weight infants.
Abstract
  The relation between early mother-infant skin-to-skin contact (SSC) and mothers' subsequent sensitivity to their low birth weight infants was investigated in a study of 12 mother-infant dyads who participated in a South African randomized control study of early SSC. The dyads were visited in the home when infants were under 1 year. Amounts of SSC were taken from hospital records and home interviews. Videotapes of mother-infant interactions in the home were scored for maternal sensitivity on the Maternal Behavior Q-Sort (D.R. Pederson, G. Moran, & S. Bento, 1999) and the Maternal Behavior subscale of the Nursing Child Assessment Teaching Scale (G. Sumner & A. Spietz, 1994). Amount of SSC in infants' first 24 hr correlated with amount of SSC through the first month. Amount of SSC in infants' first 24 hr independently accounted for maternal sensitivity on both measures, indicating that early mother-infant SSC predicted subsequent maternal sensitivity.

Title
  Effect of skin-to-skin contact on preterm infant skin barrier function and hospital-acquired infection.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: The preterm infants' skin is structurally and functionally immature at birth because of immature stratum corneum barrier function, leading to problems with fluid loses, thermoregulation, and infection. Two parameters of barrier function can be non-invasively assessed: Stratum Corneum Hydration (SCH) and Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL). Skin-to-Skin Care (SSC) is the proposed independent variable that might affect barrier function by decreasing TEWL and increasing SCH, thereby improving stratum corneum barrier function and consequently decreasing the rate of infection. No study of SSC's effects on TEWL and SCH of preterm infants could be found. The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of 5 daily Skin-to-Skin Contact sessions on infant skin hydration (SCH), transepidermal evaporated water loss (TEWL), and on SCH when TEWL was controlled, and on the presence of hospital acquired infection.

   METHODS: A one-group pretest-test-posttest design with 10 preterm infants (28 - 30 wks GA < 32 wks postmenstrual age, and no infection at entry). Test = 90 minutes of SSC; pre-test and post-test = 30 minutes each of prone positioning in an incubator. SCH and TEWL were taken on Days 1 and 5 at the beginning, middle and end of each period using Multi-Probe Adaptor. A 3 X 3 X 2 Repeated Measures Mixed Models Design, including a covariate, was used to analyze level of Skin Hydration. Specifically, the model tested comparisons in SCH made across repetitions, time, and days, as well as all possible interactions while controlling for TEWL. Descriptive statistics described the number of positive blood cultures during hospitalization and the presence of infections four weeks post-discharge.

   RESULTS: Significant differences in skin hydration were found across TIME (Pre-SSC, SSC, Post-SSC) (F = 21.86; p < 0.001). One infant had a positive blood culture during hospitalization; no infants had signs of infection by 4 weeks post-discharge.

   CONCLUSIONS: The study has begun fulfilling the recommendation that SSC be tested as a strategy to improve skin hydration, but reveals that evaporative loss may be higher during SSC than during incubator care, and that the higher transepidermal evaporated water loss values may not necessarily be detrimental because few infections occurred even in its presence. A definitive randomized controlled trial is recommended.

   KEYWORDS: Skin-to-skin contact; Skin hydration; Transepidermal water loss; Infection; Preterm.

Title
  Breastmilk cultures and infection in extremely premature infants.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: As expressed mother's milk (MM) is known to be colonized by microbial species, it is occasionally considered as a source of infection in premature infants, prompting some clinicians to obtain milk bacterial culture results before infant feeding. To determine whether serial microbial cultures of MM predict infection in premature infants.

   STUDY DESIGN: Milk microbial flora was determined by plate counts from aliquots of MM obtained from 161 mothers of infants born <30 weeks gestation (n = 209). Pathogens isolated from the same infant were tabulated.

   RESULT: Milk samples (n = 813) yielded 1963 isolates. There were no relationships between microbial counts and maternal age, ethnicity, education, skin-to-skin contact and infant infection. In 64 infants, milk and pathological isolates had presumptively the same Gram-positive organism, yet the odds of infection before or after exposure to milk containing that Gram-positive organism were not significant (1.18; 95% confidence interval=0.51, 2.76). In eight infants, milk and pathological isolates had presumptively the same Gram-negative organism, which appeared sporadically in milk, either before or after isolation in the infant.

   CONCLUSION: Results of initial milk cultures do not predict subsequent culture results. Random milk cultures, even if obtained at any time during hospitalization, are not predictive of infection in premature infants. The sporadic nature of the appearance of certain isolates, however, suggests common exposure of both mother and infant. Routine milk cultures do not provide sufficient data to be useful in clinical management.

Title
  Mortality in out-of-hospital premature births.
Abstract
  AIM: To determine whether the mortality for out-of-hospital (OOH) premature births was higher than for in-hospital premature births and identify additional risk factors.

   PATIENTS AND METHODS: A historical cohort study of a consecutive series of live-born, OOH, births of 24-35 weeks gestation cared for by two Transport Teams working in and around Paris, France 1994-2005. Matching with in-hospital births was according to gestational age, antenatal steroid use, the mode of delivery and nearest year of birth.

   RESULTS: Eighty-five OOH premature births were identified, of whom 83 met inclusion criteria, and 132 matching in-hospital premature births were selected. There was 18% mortality in the OOH group compared with 8% for the in-hospital group [p = 0.04, OR 2.9, (CI 95% 1.0-8.4)]. Variables significantly associated (p < 0.05) with the OOH birth were HIV infection, lower maternal age and endo-tracheal intubation, lack of medical follow-up during pregnancy, low temperature and low birth weight.

   CONCLUSIONS: Mortality was more than twice as high in out-of-hospital deliveries than for in-hospital matched controls. Hypothermia was an important associated risk factor. Measures such as oxygen administration to maintain an appropriate saturation for gestational age, the provision of polyethylene plastic wraps and skin-to-skin contact are recommended.

Title
  Pain management in newborns: from prevention to treatment. [Review]
Abstract
  All neonates in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) or during the first days of life undergo painful and stressful procedures. Epidemiologic studies have shown that pain induced by these procedures is not effectively prevented or is inadequately treated. Pain experienced during the neonatal period may lead to negative outcomes, especially in preterm neonates. Prevention is the first step of pain management, and practical guidelines should be used in the NICU. Assessment must be done with adequate tools that take into account the infant's pathology and gestational age. Distinguishing between acute and prolonged pain is important for both assessment and treatment. The most common drugs that have been studied for the treatment of pain and stress are opioids, hypnosedatives, and NMDA receptor antagonists. Morphine and fentanyl are most frequently used for acute or prolonged pain in the NICU. They have potent analgesic effects and few immediate or long-term adverse effects. Midazolam is a commonly used hypnosedative, but its adverse effects limit its use. Drugs such as propofol and ketamine have been used for acute painful procedures; however, further research is needed to assess their long-term effects. Use of non-pharmacologic pain management techniques has increased in recent years. These methods are easy, inexpensive, and effective in helping newborns recover from painful procedures. Sweet solutions and non-nutritive sucking, breastfeeding, skin-to-skin mother care, swaddling, and facilitated tucking are the most commonly employed and evaluated non-pharmacologic methods. Hospitals should promote and improve parent involvement in pain management. In-service education and well organized hospital teams are crucial for successful implementation of pain protocols in newborns.

Title
  An innovative model for achieving breast-feeding success in infants with complex surgical anomalies.
Abstract
  This manuscript describes an innovative nurse-driven continuous quality improvement project. Infants born with congenital surgical anomalies face significant challenges within the newborn period and human milk/breast-feeding may not be viewed as a priority. In many hospitals, nurses refer families to lactation consultants for all breast-feeding assistance and support. The Transition to Breast Pathway was developed on the basis of the evidence-based standards and protocols at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. The pathway consists of (1) initiation of pumping and maintenance of milk supply, (2) mouth care with human milk, (3) skin-to-skin care, (4) nonnutritive sucking at the breast, (5) transitioning to at breast feeds. A sample of 80 infants were enrolled in this project. Major results of the project are as follows: (1) mother's average milk supply was approximately 603 mL/d, (2) 71% (57/80) of the infants received mouth care with human milk, (3) 48% (38/80) mother/infant dyads performed skin-to-skin care, (4) 60% (35/58) of mother/infant dyads performed nonnutritive sucking at the breast, (5) 100% (58/58) of mother-infant dyads transitioned to breast prior to discharge. This continuous quality improvement project demonstrates that nurses can and should lead the process of transitioning infants to at breast feeds.

Title
  Maternal holding of preterm infants during the early weeks after birth and dyad interaction at six months.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To examine whether a supportive nursing intervention that promoted kangaroo holding of healthy preterm infants by their mothers during the early weeks of the infant's life facilitated coregulation between mother and infant at 6 months of age.

   DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.

   PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-five mother/infant dyads with mean gestational age at birth of 33 weeks. Fifty percent of infants were male, and 50% were non-White.

   INTERVENTIONS: An 8-week home intervention encouraged daily 1-hour, uninterrupted holding with either blanket (baby wrapped in blanket and held in mother's arms) or the kangaroo (baby in skin-to-skin contact on mother's chest) method. In both conditions, weekly home visits by an experienced RN included encouragement to hold the infant, emotional support, and information about infant behavior and development. A control group received brief social visits, had no holding constraints, and participated in all assessments.

   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: When infants were 6 months of age, the Still-Face Paradigm was used to assess mother/infant interaction. Outcome measures were coregulation of the dyad's responses during the play episodes of the Still-Face Paradigm and vitality in infant efforts to reengage the mother during the neutral face portion of the Still-Face Procedure.

   RESULTS: Significant differences among groups were found in mother/infant coregulation. Post hoc analysis showed that dyads who were supported in kangaroo holding displayed more coregulation behavior during play than dyads in the blanket-holding group. No differences were found between groups in infant vitality during the neutral face portion of the Still-Face Procedure.

   CONCLUSION: Dyads supported in practicing kangaroo holding in the early weeks of life may develop more coregulated interactional strategies than other dyads.

Title
  Neonatal hypothermia and associated risk factors among newborns of southern Nepal.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Neonatal hypothermia is associated with an increased mortality risk for 28 days. There are few community-based data on specific risk factors for neonatal hypothermia. Estimates of association between neonatal hypothermia in the community and risk factors are needed to guide the design of interventions to reduce exposure.

   METHODS: A cohort of 23,240 babies in rural southern Nepal was visited at home by field workers who measured axillary temperatures for 28 days (213,316 temperature measurements). The cumulative incidence of hypothermia (defined as < 35.0 degrees C based on an analysis of the hypothermia-mortality risk relationship) was examined for any association with infant characteristics, care practices and parental, household, socioeconomic and demographic factors. Estimates were adjusted for age and ambient temperature.

   RESULTS: Ten percent of the babies (n = 2342) were observed with temperatures of < 35.0 degrees C. Adjusted prevalence ratios (Adj PR) were increased among those who weighed < 2000 g [Adj PR = 4.32 (3.73, 5.00)] or < 1500 g [Adj PR = 11.63 (8.10, 16.70)] compared to those of normal weight (> 2500 g). Risk varied inversely along the entire weight spectrum: for every 100 g decrement hypothermia risk increased by 7.4%, 13.5% and 31.3%% for babies between 3000 g and 2500 g, 2500 g and 2000 g and < 2000 g, respectively. Preterm babies (< 34 weeks), females, those who had been first breastfed after 24 h and those with hypothermic mothers were at an increased risk. In the hot season the risk disparity between smaller and larger babies increased. Hypothermia was not associated with delayed bathing, hat wearing, room warming or skin-to-skin contact: they may have been practiced reactively and thereby obscured any potential benefit.

   CONCLUSIONS: In addition to season in which the babies were born, weight is an important risk factor for hypothermia. Smaller babies are at higher relative risk of hypothermia during the warm period and do not receive the protective seasonal benefit apparent among larger babies. The need for year-round thermal care, early breastfeeding and maternal thermal care should be emphasized. Further work is needed to quantify the benefits of other simple neonatal thermal care practices.

Title
  Extremely preterm infants tolerate skin-to-skin contact during the first weeks of life.
Abstract
  AIM: To determine if clinically stable extremely preterm infants can maintain their temperature during skin-to-skin contact and to screen for other negative effects.

   METHODS: Continuous measurement of 22 stable infants' physical parameters 2 h before, during, and 2 h after skin-to-skin-contact. Mean gestational age at birth was 25 weeks and 4 days, mean post-natal age was 8 days, postmenstrual age was 26 weeks and 6 days, and mean actual weight 702 g. Mean duration of skin-to-skin-contact was 98 min. 16 infants were skin-to-skin with the mother, five with the father and one with an older sister.

   RESULTS: There were no significant differences in mean skin temperature, heart rate, respiration rate, or oxygen saturation before, during, and after skin-to-skin contact. While staying within normal range, the mean skin temperature increased 0.1 degrees C during skin-to-skin contact with the mother and decreased 0.3 degrees C during skin-to-skin contact with the father (p = 0.011) (without post-hoc correction).

   CONCLUSION: Clinically stable, extremely preterm infants can keep adequate skin temperature and adequate physical stability during skin-to-skin contact with their parents.

Title
  Interventions to prevent hypothermia at birth in preterm and/or low birthweight infants. [Review] [162 refs]
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Keeping vulnerable preterm infants warm is problematic even when recommended routine thermal care guidelines are followed in the delivery suite.

   OBJECTIVES: To assess efficacy and safety of interventions designed for prevention of hypothermia in preterm and/or low birthweight infants applied within 10 minutes after birth in the delivery suite compared with routine thermal care.

   SEARCH STRATEGY: We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group (CNRG). The review was updated in October 2009.

   SELECTION CRITERIA: Trials using randomised or quasi-randomised allocations to test a specific intervention designed to prevent hypothermia, (apart from 'routine' thermal care) applied within 10 minutes after birth in the delivery suite to infants of < 37 weeks' gestational age or birthweight </= 2500 g.

   DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the methods of the CNRG for data collection and analysis.

   MAIN RESULTS: 1) Barriers to heat loss [5 studies; plastic wrap or bag (3), plastic cap (1), stockinet cap (1)]:Plastic wraps or bags were effective in reducing heat losses in infants < 28 weeks' gestation (4 studies, n = 223; WMD 0.68 degrees C; 95% CI 0.45, 0.91), but not in infants between 28 to 31 week's gestation. Plastic caps were effective in reducing heat losses in infants < 29 weeks' gestation (1 study, n = 64; MD 0.80 degrees C; 95% CI 0.41, 1.19). There was insufficient evidence to suggest that either plastic wraps or plastic caps reduce the risk of death within hospital stay. There was no evidence of significant differences in other clinical outcomes for either the plastic wrap/bag or the plastic cap comparisons. Stockinet caps were not effective in reducing heat losses.2) External heat sources [2 studies; skin-to-skin (1), transwarmer mattress (1)]:Skin-to-skin care (SSC) was shown to be effective in reducing the risk of hypothermia when compared to conventional incubator care for infants (1 study, n = 31; RR 0.09; 95% CI 0.01, 0.64). The transwarmer mattress reduced the incidence of hypothermia on admission to NICU in VLBW infants (1 study, n = 24; RR 0.30; 95% CI 0.11, 0.83).

   AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Plastic wraps or bags, plastic caps, SSC and transwarmer mattresses all keep preterm infants warmer leading to higher temperatures on admission to neonatal units and less hypothermia. However, the small numbers of infants and studies and the absence of long-term follow-up mean that firm recommendations for clinical practice cannot be given. [References: 162]

Title
  Massage therapy improves neurodevelopment outcome at two years corrected age for very low birth weight infants.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Long term effects of massage therapy in very preterm newborns infants are still to be described. Few studies evaluated neurodevelopment just at six months, and included late preterm infants.

   OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of massage therapy on neurodevelopment of very low birth weight infants at two years corrected age.

   STUDY DESIGN: Newborns with birth weight between >or= 750 and <or= 1500 g and gestational age <or= 32 weeks were randomly assigned to massage therapy by mothers plus skin-to-skin care (Intervention Group) or just skin-to-skin care (Control Group) during their hospital stay. Growth and neurodevelopment outcome were evaluated at 2 years corrected age.

   RESULTS: We followed 73 newborns (35 in Intervention Group, and 38 in Control Group). Both groups were similar in neonatal data. Growth at 2 years corrected age was similar in both groups. Intervention Group had borderline higher Psychomotor Development Index and significantly higher Mental Development Index scores than Control Group.

   CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that massage therapy by mothers combined to skin-to-skin care during neonatal hospital stay improves neurodevelopment outcome at 2 years corrected age.

Title
  Impact of skin to skin care, prone and supine positioning on cardiorespiratory parameters and thermoregulation in premature infants.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Skin to skin care (SSC), prone (PP) and supine (SP) positions are standard positions in daily care for premature infants. Their influence on cardiorespiratory parameters and thermoregulation is discussed controversially.

   OBJECTIVES: We compared SSC with PP, the recommended position for preterm infants, and SP, the safest position for term infants, and tested the hypothesis that SSC has no impact on cardiorespiratory parameters and thermoregulation.

   METHODS: In 18 spontaneously breathing premature infants [median gestational 28 weeks (24-32); chronological age 36 days (7-64), and weight 1,543 g (750-2,100)], heart and respiratory rate, breathing pattern, episodes of desaturation (<85 but >or=80 and <80%), oxygen saturation and rectal temperature were analyzed with polygraphy (Alice 3(R) and 3.5(R)) in a 6-hour measuring cycle of three subsequent series (120 min each in SP, SSC and PP) and compared (Wilcoxon test).

   RESULTS: During SSC, we found no increase in apneic attacks and bradycardic episodes and no difference in respiratory rate, breathing pattern, oxygen saturation, episodes and duration of desaturation compared to SP and PP. Episodes of desaturation <85 but >or=80 and <80% were more frequent in SP compared to PP (p = 0.0421 and p = 0.0319). Heart rate increased in SSC and PP compared to SP (154.86 bpm, SD 11.55, and 153.33 bpm, SD 15.95 vs. 150.25 bpm, SD 14.64; p = 0.0013 and p = 0.0346). Temperature level was not significantly higher during SSC and PP compared to SP except a rise between the start and the end of the 6-hour measuring cycle (37.05 degrees C, SD 0.2 vs. 37.30 degrees C, SD 0.3; p = 0.0436).

   CONCLUSION: We found no significant SSC-mediated changes in quality and quantity of desaturations and in body temperature compared to PP in preterm infants. Copyright 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Title
  Breastfeeding promotion for infants in neonatal units: a systematic review and economic analysis. [Review] [288 refs]
Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of interventions that promote or inhibit breastfeeding or feeding with breastmilk for infants admitted to neonatal units, and to identify an agenda for future research.

   DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases were searched (including MEDLINE and MEDLINE In-Process Citations, EMBASE, CINAHL, Maternity and Infant Care, PsycINFO, British Nursing Index and Archive, Health Management Information Consortium, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Science Citation Index, Pascal, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences, MetaRegister of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness, Health Technology Assessment Database, National Research Register) from inception to February 2008. Advisors identified further published or unpublished material.

   REVIEW METHODS: All papers fulfilled eligibility criteria covering participants, interventions, study design and outcomes. Results from primary studies were assessed and summarised in a qualitative synthesis for each type of intervention and across types of intervention. To estimate long-term cost utility, a decision tree was developed to synthesise data on enhanced staff contact, breastmilk effectiveness, incidence of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) and sepsis, resource use, survival and utilities.

   RESULTS: Forty-eight studies met the selection criteria for the effectiveness review, of which 65% (31/48) were RCTs, and 17% (8/48) were conducted in the UK. Seven were rated as good quality and 28 as moderate quality. No studies met the selection criteria for the health economics review. There is strong evidence that short periods of kangaroo skin-to-skin contact increased the duration of any breastfeeding for 1 month after discharge [risk ratio (RR) 4.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19 to 19.10] and for more than 6 weeks (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.03 to 3.70) among clinically stable infants in industrialised settings. There is strong evidence for the effectiveness of peer support at home (in Manila) for mothers of term, low birthweight infants on any breastfeeding up to 24 weeks (RR 2.18, 95% CI 1.45 to 3.29) and exclusive breastfeeding from birth to 6 months (RR 65.94, 95% CI 4.12 to 1055.70), and for the effectiveness of peer support in hospital and at home for mothers of infants in Special Care Baby Units on providing any breastmilk at 12 weeks [odds ratio (OR) 2.81, 95% CI 1.11 to 7.14; p = 0.01]. There is more limited evidence for the effectiveness of skilled professional support in a US Neonatal Intensive Care Unit on infants receiving any breastmilk at discharge (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2 to 3.2, p = 0.004). Multidisciplinary staff training may increase knowledge and can increase initiation rates and duration of breastfeeding, although evidence is limited. Lack of staff training is an important barrier to implementation of effective interventions. Baby Friendly accreditation of the associated maternity hospital results in improvements in several breastfeeding-related outcomes for infants in neonatal units. Limited evidence suggests that cup feeding (versus bottle feeding) may increase breastfeeding at discharge and reduce the frequency of oxygen desaturation. Breastmilk expression using simultaneous pumping with an electric pump has advantages in the first 2 weeks. Pharmaceutical galactagogues have little benefit among mothers who have recently given birth. Our economic analysis found that additional skilled professional support in hospital was more effective and less costly (due to reduced neonatal illness) than normal staff contact. Additional support ranged from 0.009 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) to 0.251 QALYs more beneficial per infant and ranged from 66 pounds to 586 pounds cheaper per infant across the birthweight subpopulations. Donor milk would become cost-effective given improved mechanisms for its provision.

   CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limitations of the evidence base, kangaroo skin-to-skin contact, peer support, simultaneous breastmilk pumping, multidisciplinary staff training and the Baby Friendly accreditation of the associated maternity hospital have been shown to be effective, and skilled support from trained staff in hospital has been shown to be potentially cost-effective. All these point to future research priorities. Many of these interventions inter-relate: it is unlikely that specific clinical interventions will be effective if used alone. There is a need for national surveillance of feeding, health and cost outcomes for infants and mothers in neonatal units; to assist this goal, we propose consensus definitions of the initiation and duration of breastfeeding/breastmilk feeding with specific reference to infants admitted to neonatal units and their mothers.

Title
  Co-bedding as a Comfort measure For Twins undergoing painful procedures (CComForT Trial).
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Co-bedding, a developmental care strategy, is the practice of caring for diaper clad twins in one incubator (versus separating and caring for each infant in separate incubators), thus creating the opportunity for skin-to-skin contact and touch between the twins. In studies of mothers and their infants, maternal skin-to-skin contact has been shown to decrease procedural pain response according to both behavioral and physiological indicators in very preterm neonates. It is uncertain if this comfort is derived solely from maternal presence or from stabilization of regulatory processes from direct skin contact. The intent of this study is to compare the comfort effect of co-bedding (between twin infants who are co-bedding and those who are not) on infant pain response and physiologic stability during a tissue breaking procedure (heelstick).

   METHODS/DESIGN: Medically stable preterm twin infants admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit will be randomly assigned to a co-bedding group or a standard care group. Pain response will be measured by physiological and videotaped facial reaction using the Premature Infant Pain Profile scale (PIPP). Recovery from the tissue breaking procedure will be determined by the length of time for heart rate and oxygen saturation to return to baseline. Sixty four sets of twins (n = 128) will be recruited into the study. Analysis and inference will be based on the intention-to-treat principle.

   DISCUSSION: If twin contact while co-bedding is determined to have a comforting effect for painful procedures, then changes in current neonatal care practices to include co-bedding may be an inexpensive, non invasive method to help maintain physiologic stability and decrease the long term psychological impact of procedural pain in this high risk population. Knowledge obtained from this study will also add to existing theoretical models with respect to the exact mechanism of comfort through touch.

Title
  Skin-to-skin contact and/or oral 25% dextrose for procedural pain relief for term newborn infants.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: The goal was to compare the efficacy of oral 25% dextrose treatment and/or skin-to-skin contact for analgesia in term newborns during intramuscular injection of a hepatitis B vaccine.

   METHODS: A prospective, randomized, partially blinded, clinical trial was performed with 640 healthy term newborns. Infants at 12 to 72 hours of life were assigned randomly to receive an intramuscular injection of hepatitis B vaccine in the right thigh according to 4 analgesia groups, that is, no analgesia (routine); oral 25% dextrose treatment, given 2 minutes before the injection; skin-to-skin contact, initiated 2 minutes before the injection and persisting throughout the procedure; and a combination of the oral dextrose treatment and skin-to-skin contact strategies. For all groups, Neonatal Facial Coding System and Neonatal Infant Pain Scale scores were evaluated before the procedure, during thigh cleansing, during the injection, and 2 minutes after the injection. Premature Infant Pain Profile scores also were assessed for all infants. Pain scores were compared among the 4 groups.

   RESULTS: The use of oral 25% dextrose treatment reduced the duration of procedural pain in the studied population. Skin-to-skin contact decreased injection pain and duration. The combination of the 2 analgesic measures was more effective than either measure separately for term newborns.

   CONCLUSIONS: Nonpharmacologic analgesic measures were effective for the treatment of procedural pain in term infants. The combination of oral 25% dextrose treatment and skin-to-skin contact acted synergistically to decrease acute pain in healthy neonates.

Title
  Neurophysiologic assessment of brain maturation after an 8-week trial of skin-to-skin contact on preterm infants.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Skin-to-skin contact (SSC) promotes physiological stability and interaction between parents and infants. Analyses of EEG-sleep studies can compare functional brain maturation between SSC and non-SSC cohorts.

   METHODS: Sixteen EEG-sleep studies were performed on eight preterm infants who received 8 weeks of SSC, and compared with two non-SSC cohorts at term (N=126), a preterm group corrected to term age and a full-term group. Seven linear and two complexity measures were compared (Mann-Whitney U test comparisons p<.05).

   RESULTS: Fewer REMs, more quiet sleep, increased respiratory regularity, longer cycles, and less spectral beta were noted for SSC preterm infants compared with both control cohorts. Fewer REMs, greater arousals and more quiet sleep were noted for SSC infants compared with the non-SSC preterms at term. Three right hemispheric regions had greater complexity in the SSC group. Discriminant analysis showed that the SSC cohort was closer to the non-SSC full-term cohort.

   CONCLUSIONS: Skin-to-skin contact accelerates brain maturation in healthy preterm infants compared with two groups without SSC.

   SIGNIFICANCE: Combined use of linear and complexity analysis strategies offer complementary information regarding altered neuronal functions after developmental care interventions. Such analyses may be helpful to assess other neuroprotection strategies.

Title
  Skin care in the NICU patient: effects of wipes versus cloth and water on stratum corneum integrity.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: NICU patients are at risk of skin breakdown due to prematurity, irritant exposure, medical status and stress. There is a need to minimize damage, facilitate skin development and reduce infection risk, but the literature on the effects of skin care practices in NICU patients is limited.

   OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that baby diaper wipes with emollient cleansers and a soft cloth would minimize skin compromise relative to cloth and water.

   METHODS: In 130 NICU infants (gestational age 23-41 weeks, at enrollment 30-51 weeks), measurements of skin condition, i.e., skin erythema, skin rash, transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and surface acidity (pH), within the diaper and at diaper and chest control sites were determined daily for 5-14 days using standardized methods. Treatments were randomly assigned based on gestational age and starting skin irritation score: wipe A, wipe B, and the current cloth and water NICU standard of care.

   RESULTS: Perineal erythema and TEWL were significantly lower for wipes A and B than cloth and water beginning at day 5 for erythema (scores of 1.11 +/- 0.05, 1.2 +/- 0.05, and 1.4 +/- 0.06, respectively) and day 7 for TEWL (28.2 +/- 1.6, 28.8 +/- 1.6, and 35.2 +/- 1.6 g/m(2)/h, respectively). Wipe B produced a significantly lower skin pH (day 5, 5.47 +/- 0.03) than wipe A (5.71 +/- 0.03) and cloth and water (5.67 +/- 0.04). The starting skin condition, stool total, age and time on current standard impacted the outcomes.

   CONCLUSIONS: Both wipes are appropriate for use on medically stable NICU patients, including both full and preterm infants, and provide more normalized skin condition and barrier function versus the cloth and water standard. Wipe B may facilitate acid mantle development and assist in colonization, infection control and barrier repair. Neonatal skin continues to change for up to 8 weeks postnatally, presumably as it adapts to the dry extra-uterine environment. Copyright 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Title
  Effect of early skin-to-skin contact on mother-preterm infant interaction through 18 months: randomized controlled trial.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Preterm birth often negatively influences mother-infant interaction. Skin-to-skin contact postbirth has positive effects on maternal feelings toward their preterm infants and on infant development and family interaction. However, little is known about the long-term effects of skin-to-skin contact on mother-late preterm infant interaction when skin-to-skin contact was experienced early postbirth and intermittently throughout the next five days.

   OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this report was to examine the effect of skin-to-skin contact on mother-late preterm infant interaction through 18 months.

   DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial with follow-up.

   SETTING: Two hospitals in the United States of America.

   PARTICIPANTS: 100 mothers and their late preterm infants, 32 to <37 weeks' gestation, were recruited. Mother-preterm infant interactions were assessed in 69, 70, and 76 dyads at 6, 12, and 18 months.

   METHODS: Mothers and their preterm infants were videotaped during a feeding session at 6 and 12 months, and a teaching session at 6, 12, and 18 months. Their interactions were then scored using the Nursing Child Assessment Satellite Feeding Scale and Teaching Scale.

   RESULTS: Skin-to-skin contact and control dyads had comparable feeding scores at 6 and 12 months. Skin-to-skin contact infants had lower infant teaching scores at six months, a difference that disappeared thereafter.

   CONCLUSIONS: These inconclusive results call for additional studies with larger doses of skin-to-skin contact, larger sample sizes, and other outcome measures of mother-late preterm infant interactions. Such measures include the Parent-Child Early Relational Assessment and behavioral coding during play.

Title
  Point-of-admission hypothermia among high-risk Nigerian newborns.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Facilities which manage high-risk babies should frequently assess the burden of hypothermia and strive to reduce the incidence.

   OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence and outcome of point-of-admission hypothermia among hospitalized babies.

   METHODS: The axillary temperatures of consecutive admissions into a Nigerian Newborn Unit were recorded. Temperature <36.5 degrees C defined hypothermia. The biodata and outcome of these babies were studied.

   RESULTS: Of 150 babies aged 0 to 648 hours, 93 had hypothermia with an incidence of 62%. Mild and moderate hypothermia accounted for 47.3% and 52.7% respectively. The incidence of hypothermia was highest (72.4%) among babies aged less than 24 hours. It was also higher among out-born babies compared to in-born babies (64.4% vs 58.3%). Preterm babies had significantly higher incidence of hypothermia (82.5%) compared with 54.5% of term babies (RR = 1.51; CI = 1.21 - 1.89). The incidence of hypothermia was also highest (93.3%) among very-low-birth-weight babies. The Case-Fatality-Rate was significantly higher among hypothermic babies (37.6% vs 16.7%; RR = 2.26, CI = 1.14 - 4.48) and among out-born hypothermic babies (50% vs 17.1%; RR = 0.34, CI = 0.16 - 0.74). CFR was highest among hypothermic babies with severe respiratory distress, sepsis, preterm birth and asphyxia.

   CONCLUSION: The high incidence and poor outcome of hypothermia among high-risk babies is important. The use of the 'warm chain' and skin-to-skin contact between mother and her infant into routine delivery services in health facilities and at home may be useful.

Title
  Infants admitted to neonatal units--interventions to improve breastfeeding outcomes: a systematic review 1990-2007. [Review] [74 refs]
Abstract
  This review aimed to identify interventions to promote breastfeeding or breast milk feeding for infants admitted to the neonatal unit. The medical electronic databases were searched for papers listed between 1990 and June 2005 which had breastfeeding or breast milk as an outcome and which targeted infants who had been admitted to a neonatal unit, thus including the infant and/or their parents and/or neonatal unit staff. Only papers culturally relevant to the UK were included resulting in studies from the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. This search was updated in December 2007 to include publications up to this date. We assessed 86 papers in full, of which 27 ultimately fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The studies employed a range of methods and targeted different aspects of breastfeeding in the neonatal unit. Variations in study type and outcomes meant that there was no clear message of what works best but skin-to-skin contact and additional postnatal support seemed to offer greater advantage for the infant in terms of breastfeeding outcome. Galactogogues for mothers who are unable to meet their infants' needs may also help to increase milk supply. Evidence of an effect from other practices, such as cup-feeding on breastfeeding was limited; mainly because of a lack of research but also because few studies followed up the population beyond discharge from the unit. Further research is required to explore the barriers to breastfeeding in this vulnerable population and to identify appropriate interventions to improve breastfeeding outcomes. [References: 74]

Title
  Massage therapy reduces hospital stay and occurrence of late-onset sepsis in very preterm neonates.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of maternal massage therapy on hospital stay in very-low-birth-weight infants who were already submitted to skin-to-skin care.

   STUDY DESIGN: A randomized study was performed including infants of birth weight >or=750 and <or=1500 g and gestational age <or=32 weeks. The exclusion criteria were as follows: death before completing 48 h and presence of major malformations. Neonates were divided into intervention group (IG) (standard care plus maternal massage) and control group (CG). Anthropometric data were always verified by a person blind to the group to which the newborn belonged. Maternal massage was performed four times a day on the face and limbs. Passive exercises of upper and lower limbs were also done by the mothers.

   RESULT: A total of 104 newborns were included, 52 in each group. Both groups were similar in gestational age (IG: 29.7+/-1.6; CG: 29.4+/-1.6 weeks), birth weight (IG: 1186+/-194; CG: 1156+/-198 g), gender, number of small-for-gestational-age infants, SNAPPE-II, deaths, gains in weight, length and head circumference. Incidence of late-onset sepsis was significantly lower in the intervention group (IG: 10.8%, n=5; CG: 38.3%, n=18; P=0.005). IG was discharged from the hospital 7 days before CG (IG: 42, confidence interval (CI) 95%: 38 to 46; CG: 49, CI 95%: 42 to 56), and presented 1.85 hazard ratio (CI 95%: 1.09 to 3.13; P=0.023) for early discharge.

   CONCLUSION: Maternal massage therapy in very-low-birth-weight infants decreases the length of hospital stay and the incidence of late-onset neonatal sepsis.

Title
  The effect of daily treatment with an olive oil/lanolin emollient on skin integrity in preterm infants: a randomized controlled trial.
Abstract
  To date, appropriate skin therapy for premature infants has not been clearly defined. Emollient creams are often used without solid evidence for a benefit to the neonate. The aim of the current study was to investigate the cutaneous effects of two different topical ointment therapies. Between October 2004 and November 2006 we prospectively enrolled 173 infants between 25 and 36 weeks of gestation admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit. Infants were randomly assigned to daily topical treatment with water-in-oil emollient cream (Bepanthen), olive oil cream (70% lanolin, 30% olive oil), or to a control group. Each neonate was continuously treated for a maximum of 4 weeks. Skin condition (skin score reflecting degree of dermatitis) in these groups was compared at weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4. Neonates treated with olive oil cream showed statistically less dermatitis than did neonates treated with emollient cream, and both had a better outcome than those in the control group (p < 0.001 in weeks 2-4). Treatment effects persisted throughout the study period and applied to infants of all gestational ages. This study demonstrates that topical skin therapy lowers the risk of dermatitis. Olive oil cream was superior to water-in-oil emollient cream.

Title
  A comparison of mothers' and fathers' experiences of the attachment process in a neonatal intensive care unit.
Abstract
  AIM: To compare mothers' and fathers' individual views and experiences of the attachment process in a neonatal intensive care unit within the first week after a premature birth.

   BACKGROUND: The attachment between parents and children is a precursor to the consolidation of parenting skills, the growth and development of the infant and the establishment of a bond between parent and child. Premature birth and the resultant hospitalization disrupt the normal attachment process between parent and child. Most of the literature on attachment theory focuses on the mother-child connection and is being criticised for regarding the father's role as supportive and peripheral.

   METHODS: The design of this study was descriptive with a hermeneutic approach. Twelve parents (six mothers and six fathers) in a 13-bed neonatal intensive care unit in a Norwegian regional hospital participated in a field study addressing the encounter between parents and nurses. This paper is based on the semi-structured interviews with the parents at discharge.

   RESULTS: The interview analysis revealed two main categories. (a) Taken by surprise: For mothers, the premature birth created a feeling of powerlessness and they experienced the immediate postnatal period as surreal and strange. The fathers experienced the birth as a shock, but were ready to be involved immediately. (b) Building a relationship: Mothers experienced a need to regain the temporarily lost relationship with their child, whereas the fathers experienced the beginning of a new relationship.

   CONCLUSION: Comparing parents' experiences of the attachment process within the first days after a premature birth reveals a striking contrast between the mother's experience of surrealism and the father's ability to be involved immediately after birth. Relevance to clinical practice. Parents' of premature children's different starting points should be acknowledged as professionals encourage parents to have early skin-to-skin contact with their premature infant.

Title
  Interventions to prevent hypothermia at birth in preterm and/or low birthweight infants. [Review] [140 refs]
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Hypothermia incurred during routine postnatal resuscitation is a world-wide issue (across all climates), associated with morbidity and mortality. Keeping vulnerable preterm infants warm is problematic even when recommended routine thermal care guidelines are followed in the delivery suite.

   OBJECTIVES: To assess efficacy and safety of interventions designed for prevention of hypothermia in preterm and/or low birthweight infants applied within ten minutes after birth in the delivery suite compared with routine thermal care.

   SEARCH STRATEGY: The standard search strategy of The Cochrane Collaboration was followed. Electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE (1966 to July Week 4 2007 ), CINAHL (1982 to July Week 4 2007), EMBASE (1974 to 01/08/2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2007), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE 1994 to July 2007), conference/symposia proceedings using ZETOC (1993 to 17/08/2007), ISI proceedings (1990 to 17/08/2007) and OCLC WorldCat (July 2007). Identified articles were cross-referenced. No language restrictions were imposed.

   SELECTION CRITERIA: All trials using randomised or quasi-randomised allocations to test a specific intervention designed to prevent hypothermia, (apart from 'routine' thermal care) applied within 10 minutes after birth in the delivery suite to infants of < 37 weeks' gestational age or birthweight </=2500 g.

   DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Methodological quality was assessed and data were extracted for important clinical outcomes including adverse effects of the intervention by at least three independent review authors. Authors were contacted for missing data. Data were analysed using RevMan 4.2.5. Relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat (NNT) with 95% confidence limits were calculated for each dichotomous outcome and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence limits for continuous outcomes.

   MAIN RESULTS: Six studies giving a total of 304 infants randomised and 295 completing the studies were included. Four comparisons to 'routine care' were undertaken within two categories:1) barriers to heat loss (four studies): plastic wrap or bag (three), stockinet caps (one) and2) external heat sources (two studies): skin-to-skin (one), transwarmer mattress (one). Plastic barriers were effective in reducing heat losses in infants < 28 weeks' gestation (three studies, n = 159; WMD 0.76 degrees C; 95% CI 0.49, 1.03), but not in infants between 28 to 31 week's gestation. There was insufficient evidence to suggest that plastic wrap reduces the risk of death within hospital stay (three studies, n = 161; typical RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.32, 1.22; typical RD -0.09; 95% CI -0.20, 0.03). There was no evidence of a significant difference in major brain injury, mean duration of oxygen therapy or hospitalisation for infants < 29 weeks' gestation. Stockinet caps were not effective (borderline significant for infants < 2000 g birthweight) in reducing heat losses.Skin-to-skin care was shown to be effective in reducing the risk of hypothermia when compared to conventional incubator care for infants 1200 to 2199 g birthweight (one study, n = 31; RR 0.09; 95% CI 0.01, 0.64; NNT 2; 2 to 4). The transwarmer mattress kept infants </=1500 g significantly warmer and reduced the incidence of hypothermia on admission to NICU(one study, n = 24; RR 0.30; 95% CI 0.11, 0.83; NNT 2 range 2 to 4).

   AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Plastic wraps or bags, skin-to-skin care and transwarmer mattresses all keep preterm infants warmer, leading to higher temperatures on admission to neonatal units and less hypothermia. Given the low NNT, consideration should be given to using these interventions in the delivery suite. However, the small numbers of infants and studies and the absence of long-term follow-up mean that firm recommendations for clinical practice cannot be given. There is a need to conduct large, high quality randomised controlled trials looking at long-term outcomes. [References: 140]

Title
  The effects of skin-to-skin contact during acute pain in preterm newborns.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Several promising non-pharmacological interventions have been developed to reduce acute pain in preterm infants including skin-to-skin contact between a mother and her infant. However, variability in physiological outcomes of existing studies on skin-to-skin makes it difficult to determine treatment effects of this naturalistic approach for the preterm infant. The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of mother and infant skin-to-skin contact during heel prick in premature infants.

   METHOD: Fifty nine stable preterm infants (born at least 30 weeks gestational age) who were undergoing routine heel lance were randomly assigned to either 15 min of skin-to-skin contact before, during and following heel prick (n=31, treatment group), or to regular care (n=28, control group). Throughout the heel lance procedure, all infants were assessed for change in facial action (NFCS), behavioral state, crying, and heart rate.

   RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were noted between the treatment and control groups during the puncture, heel squeeze and the post phases of heel prick. Infants who received skin-to-skin contact were more likely to show lower NFCS scores throughout the procedure. Both groups of infants cried and showed increased heart rate during puncture and heel squeeze although changes in these measures were less for the treated infants.

   CONCLUSIONS: Skin-to-skin contact promoted reduction in behavioral measures and less physiological increase during procedure. It is recommended that skin-to-skin contact be used as a non-pharmacologic intervention to relieve acute pain in stable premature infants born 30 weeks gestational age or older.

Title
  Recorded maternal voice for preterm neonates undergoing heel lance.
Abstract
  PURPOSE: To determine if a recording of a mother's voice talking soothingly to her baby is useful in diminishing pain in newborns born between 32 and 36 weeks' gestational age (GA) during routine painful procedures.

   BACKGROUND: While maternal skin-to-skin contact has been proven efficacious for diminishing procedural pain in both full-term and preterm neonates, it is often not possible for mothers to be present during a painful procedure. Because auditory development occurs before the third trimester of gestation, it was hypothesized that maternal voice could substitute for maternal presence and be effective in diminishing pain response.

   SUBJECTS: Preterm infants between 32 and 36 weeks' GA (n = 20) in the first 10 days of life admitted to 2 urban university-affiliated neonatal intensive care units.

   DESIGN AND METHODS: Crossover design with random ordering of condition. Following informed consent, an audio recording of the mother talking soothingly to her baby was filtered to simulate the mother's voice traveling through amniotic fluid. A final 10-minute recording of repetition of mothers' talking was recorded with maximum peaks of 70 decibels (dB) and played at levels ranging between 60 and 70 ambient decibels (dbA), selected above recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics in order to be heard over high ambient noise in the settings. This was played to her infant by a portable cassette tape player 3 times daily during a 48-hour period after feedings (gavage, bottle, or breast). At the end of 48 hours when blood work was required for clinical purposes, using a crossover design, the infant underwent the heel lancing with or without the recording being played. The order of condition was randomized, and the second condition was within 10 days. The Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) was used as primary outcome. This is a composite measure using heart rate, oxygen saturation, 3 facial actions, behavioral state, and gestational age. This measure has demonstrated reliability and validity indexes.

   RESULTS: There were no significant differences between groups on the PIPP or any of the individual components of the PIPP except a lower oxygen saturation level in the voice condition following the procedure. The second condition, regardless of whether it was voice or control, had higher heart rate scores and lower oxygen saturation scores even in the prelance baseline and warming phases. Order did not affect PIPP scores or facial actions.

   CONCLUSIONS: Different modalities of maternal presence would appear to be necessary to blunt pain response in infants, and recorded maternal voice alone is not sufficient. The loudness of the recording may have obliterated the infant's ability to discern the mother's voice and may even have been aversive, reflected in decreased oxygen saturation levels in the voice condition. Preterm neonates of 32 to 36 weeks' gestation may become sensitized to painful experiences and show anticipatory physiological response.

Title
  Short duration of skin-to-skin contact: effects on growth and breastfeeding.
Abstract
  AIM: To compare weight gain and head growth in very-low-birthweight (VLBW, <1501 g) infants with or without exposure to short duration of skin-to-skin contact (STSC) during their stay in a neonatal intensive care unit.

   METHODS: Stable VLBW infants were randomised into either STSC or control group. Parents of the STSC group were encouraged to provide STSC for at least 1 h daily.

   RESULTS: One hundred and forty-six infants were randomised, but only 126 were enrolled (STSC group: n = 64;

   CONTROLS: n = 62). Infants in the STSC group had better mean weekly increase in head circumference (1.0 cm (SD = 0.3) vs. 0.7 cm (SD = 0.3); P < 0.0001) and higher breastfeeding rate at discharge (29.7% vs. 14.5%; P = 0.04). Although the mean duration of maternal education was longer in STSC (13.0 vs. 12.1 years; P = 0.04) than in controls, linear regression analysis showed that the significant predictors associated with weekly head growth were exposure to STSC (unstandardised coefficient: 0.2; 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.1, 0.3; P < 0.0001) and head circumference of infants at the time of enrollment (unstandardised coefficient: -0.05; 95% CI: -08, -0.03; P < 0.0001); the number of years of maternal education was not a significant predictor. Logistic regression analysis showed that the only significant predictors of successful breastfeeding at discharge were receiving expressed breast milk at enrollment (adjusted OR: 4.1; 95% CI: 1.4, 11.7; P = 0.009) and receiving expressed breast milk during intervention period (adjusted OR: 8.3; 95% CI: 2.8, 24.4; P < 0.0001); exposure to STSC and maternal education were not significant predictors.

   CONCLUSION: Exposure to short duration of STSC may promote head growth in VLBW infants.

Title
  Early skin-to-skin contact for mothers and their healthy newborn infants. [Review] [111 refs]
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Mother-infant separation postbirth is common in Western culture. Early skin-to-skin contact (SSC) begins ideally at birth and involves placing the naked baby, covered across the back with a warm blanket, prone on the mother's bare chest. According to mammalian neuroscience, the intimate contact inherent in this place (habitat) evokes neurobehaviors ensuring fulfillment of basic biological needs. This time may represent a psychophysiologically 'sensitive period' for programming future behavior.

   OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of early SSC on breastfeeding, behavior, and physiological adaptation in healthy mother-newborn dyads.

   SEARCH STRATEGY: Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's and Neonatal Group's Trials Registers (August 2006), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1976 to 2006).

   SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized and quasi-randomized clinical trials comparing early SSC with usual hospital care.

   DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information.

   MAIN RESULTS: Thirty studies involving 1925 participants (mother-infant dyads), were included. Data from more than two trials were available for only 8-of-64 outcome measures. We found statistically significant and positive effects of early SSC on breastfeeding at one to four months postbirth (10 trials; 552 participants) (odds ratio (OR) 1.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 3.07), and breastfeeding duration (seven trials; 324 participants) (weighted mean difference (WMD) 42.55, 95% CI -1.69 to 86.79). Trends were found for improved summary scores for maternal affectionate love/touch during observed breastfeeding (four trials; 314 participants) (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.52, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.98) and maternal attachment behavior (six trials; 396 participants) (SMD 0.52, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.72) with early SSC. SSC infants cried for a shorter length of time (one trial; 44 participants) (WMD -8.01, 95% CI -8.98 to -7.04). Late preterm infants had better cardio-respiratory stability with early SSC (one trial; 35 participants) (WMD 2.88, 95% CI 0.53 to 5.23). No adverse effects were found.

   AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Limitations included methodological quality, variations in intervention implementation, and outcome variability. The intervention may benefit breastfeeding outcomes, early mother-infant attachment, infant crying and cardio-respiratory stability, and has no apparent short or long-term negative effects. Further investigation is recommended. To facilitate meta-analysis, future research should be done using outcome measures consistent with those in the studies included here. Published reports should clearly indicate if the intervention was SSC and include means, standard deviations, exact probability values, and data to measure intervention dose. [References: 111]

Title
  Ethnic/racial diversity, maternal stress, lactation and very low birthweight infants.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: (1) To compare maternal characteristics and psychological stress profile among African-American, Caucasian and Hispanic mothers who delivered very low birthweight infants. (2) To investigate associations between psychosocial factors, frequency of milk expression, skin-to-skin holding (STS), and lactation performance, defined as maternal drive to express milk and milk volume.

   STUDY DESIGN: Self-reported psychological questionnaires were given every 2 weeks after delivery over 10 weeks. Milk expression frequency, STS, and socioeconomic variables were collected.

   RESULT: Infant birthweight, education, and milk expression frequency differed between groups. Trait anxiety, depression and parental stress in a neonatal intensive care unit (PSS:NICU) were similar. African-American and Caucasian mothers reported the lowest scores in state anxiety and social desirability, respectively. Maternal drive to express milk, measured by maintenance of milk expression, correlated negatively with parental role alteration (subset of PSS:NICU) and positively with infant birthweight and STS. Milk volume correlated negatively with depression and positively with milk expression frequency and STS.

   CONCLUSION: Differences between groups were observed for certain psychosocial factors. The response bias to self-reported questionnaires between groups may not provide an accurate profile of maternal psychosocial profile. With different factors correlating with maintenance of milk expression and milk volume, lactation performance can be best enhanced with a multi-faceted intervention program, incorporating parental involvement in infant care, close awareness and management of maternal mental health, and encouragement for frequent milk expression and STS.

Title
  Complete chorioamniotic membrane separation with fetal restrictive dermopathy in two consecutive pregnancies.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To describe an instance of complete chorion-amnion membrane separation with fetal restrictive dermopathy in two consecutive pregnancies.

   METHODS: We performed prenatal ultrasounds in two consecutive pregnancies and evaluated gross and microscopic postnatal findings.

   RESULTS: The first pregnancy ended at 32 weeks of gestation with spontaneous chorioamniotic membrane separation and preterm premature rupture of membranes. The mother delivered an abnormal male infant with generalized fixed joint contractures, rigid and shiny skin, skin laceration around the neck, a rounded and opened mouth, and palpebral conjunctival eversion. The subsequent pregnancy was also complicated by spontaneous complete chorioamniotic membrane separation, oligohydramnios, and fetal growth restriction at 26 + 3 weeks of gestation. A immaturely born second baby also carried multiple anomalies similar to those of the first. Both infants died shortly after birth. After microscopic examination of the skin, we diagnosed the infant as restrictive dermopathy.

   CONCLUSIONS: Complete separation of the chorion-amnion membrane may be regarded as a serious prenatal condition. Restrictive dermopathy or skin disorders caused by defects in collagen or elastic tissue metabolism may be one of the many causes of chorion-amnion separation.

Title
  Introduction of community-based skin-to-skin care in rural Uttar Pradesh, India.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Two-thirds of women globally give birth at home, yet little data are available on use of skin-to-skin care (STSC) in the community. We describe the acceptability of STSC in rural Uttar Pradesh, India, and measured maternal, newborn, and ambient temperature in the home in order to inform strategies for introduction of STSC in the community.

   STUDY DESIGN: Community-based workers in intervention clusters implemented a community mobilization and behavior change communication program that promoted birth preparedness and essential newborn care, including adoption of STSC, with pregnant mothers, their families, and key influential community members. Acceptance of STSC was assessed through in-depth interviews and focus groups, and temperature was measured during home visits on day of life 0 or 1.

   RESULTS: Incidence of hypothermia (<36.5 degrees C) was high in both low birth weight (LBW) and normal birth weight (NBW) infants (49.2%, (361/733) and 43% (418/971), respectively). Mean body temperature of newborns was lower (P<0.01) in ambient temperatures <20 degrees C (35.9+/-1.4 degrees C, n=225) compared to > or =20 degrees C (36.5+/-0.9 degrees C, n=1450). Among hypothermic newborns, 42% (331/787) of their mothers had a lower temperature (range -6.7 to 0.1 degrees C, mean difference 0.4+/-1.2 degrees C). Acceptance of STSC was nearly universal. No adverse events from STSC were reported. STSC was perceived to prevent newborn hypothermia, enhance mother's capability to protect her baby from evil spirits, and make the baby more content.

   CONCLUSION: STSC was highly acceptable in rural India when introduced through appropriate cultural paradigms. STSC may be of benefit for all newborns and for many mothers as well. New approaches are needed for introduction of STSC in the community compared to the hospital.

Title
  Neurophysiologic assessment of neonatal sleep organization: preliminary results of a randomized, controlled trial of skin contact with preterm infants.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Sleep is important to brain organization, but few strategies to promote sleep among premature infants have been tested. Behaviorally based measures of sleep have shown increased quiet sleep (QS) and decreased active sleep (AS) during skin-to-skin contact (SSC) with the mother, but these results have not been confirmed with objective electroencephalographic/polysomnographic measures of sleep organization. Important differences exist between behavioral and electroencephalographic/polysomnographic definitions of sleep state.

   METHODS: Data for the first 28 relatively healthy, preterm subjects of an ongoing randomized trial of one 2- to 3-hour session of SSC or incubator care between feedings are reported here. Infants were positioned prone, inclined, and nested in an incubator during the 2- to 3-hour pretest period, were fed, and then went into the test period of SSC or incubator care. Infants were left largely undisturbed throughout testing. A mixed-model regression analysis compared the test-pretest differences in outcome measures within and between groups.

   RESULTS: Results showed that arousals were significantly lower in the SSC group, compared with the control group, for the entire study period and for test-pretest matched segments of QS and AS. Rapid eye movement was significantly lower for the SSC group for the study period and AS segments. Indeterminate sleep was significantly lower for the SSC group when confounding environmental variables were included in the regression analysis. When 4 subjects who experienced excessive ambient light levels during SSC were removed from analysis, QS increased during SSC.

   CONCLUSIONS: The patterns demonstrated by the SSC group are analogous to more-mature sleep organization. SSC may be used as an intervention to improve sleep organization in this population of preterm infants.

Title
  A controlled trial of skin-to-skin contact in extremely preterm infants.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Extremely preterm birth, even in the absence of significant neurological impairment, is associated with altered pain responses and impaired memory and behaviour. Preterm birth increases the risk of maternal depression and may impede the development of the mother-infant relationship, factors that in turn are also associated with impaired infant outcome. Mother-infant skin-to-skin contact has been recommended as a simple means of ameliorating these effects.

   METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic, prospective, controlled, intention-to-treat trial in two neonatal intensive care units. Infants born below 32 weeks gestation were recruited within the first week after birth and assigned to a control group receiving standard care, or an intervention group in which mothers were encouraged to provide a session of skin-to-skin contact once daily for 4 weeks. We assessed infant behaviour at time of discharge from hospital, responses to immunisation at 4 and 12 months of age, and memory, behaviour and development at 1 year corrected (postmenstrual) age. Indices of maternal depression, stress, anxiety, lactation performance and infant interaction were assessed at time of infant discharge, 4 months and 1 year.

   RESULTS: No significant difference was identified in any infant or maternal measure at any time point.

   CONCLUSIONS: Mother-infant skin-to-skin contact after extremely preterm birth results in neither benefit nor adverse consequences. Although there is no reason to dissuade mothers who wish to provide STS contact, we are unable to recommend resource allocation for the implementation of STS programmes for extremely preterm infants in a neonatal intensive care unit setting.

Title
  Salivary cortisol and mood and pain profiles during skin-to-skin care for an unselected group of mothers and infants in neonatal intensive care.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: Mother-infant separation after birth is a well-known source of stress. Parents and preterm infants in neonatal intensive care are separated immediately after birth. Skin-to-skin care is 1 possible method to reduce the separation-dependent stress. The aim of the present study was to investigate how skin-to-skin care influences stress for the mother and the infant in neonatal intensive care.

   METHODS: Seventeen mother-infant pairs were included at their first and fourth skin-to-skin care. The infants were 25 to 33 weeks' gestational age, with birth weights ranging from 495 to 2590 g. In mothers, salivary cortisol, heart rate, mood scale, and stress measured on a visual analog scale (VAS) were analyzed. In infants, salivary cortisol and heart rate were analyzed, and because pain is one facet of stress, 2 different pain scales were used.

   RESULTS: In mothers, the skin-to-skin care decreased salivary cortisol (32%), heart rate (7%), and VAS (89%), whereas mood increased (6%). Before the fourth skin-to-skin care, mothers rated less stress on VAS, and salivary cortisol and heart rate improved faster. The infants' cortisol either increased or decreased. Their heart rates and pain scores decreased during skin-to-skin care.

   CONCLUSIONS: Our results lend additional support to the value of skin-to-skin care in neonatal intensive care. Variable stress responses in preterm infants favor the need for individualized care. The mothers' need for support seem to be more pronounced in the first skin-to-skin session as our results show a higher degree of stress as compared with later skin-to-skin care.

Title
  Evidence for best practices in the neonatal period. [Review] [68 refs]
Abstract
  The purpose of this article is to provide a review of current nursing research that supports best practices during the newborn period. The literature review of peer-reviewed research articles published between January 2000 and October 2004 was conducted via keyword searches using the databases of the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and MEDLINE. Key words included neonatal nursing, newborn, neonate, premature infant, preterm infant, and low birthweight. Content analysis revealed the following primary categories of studies that provide solid evidence for nursing practice: developmentally focused nursing care, neonatal skin care, feeding, skin-to-skin care, and pain management. Neonatal nurse researchers have made many important contributions to the research literature. Future research should expand the findings to date on the effective use of pain scales, the outcomes of skin-to-skin care and infant massage as standard practice for all neonates, and the effectiveness of nursing interventions to support the developmental sequelae of prematurity. Neonatal nurses should become familiar with and implement those findings from nursing research that strongly support evidence-based nursing practice. [References: 68]

Title
  Randomized trial of donor human milk versus preterm formula as substitutes for mothers' own milk in the feeding of extremely premature infants.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Compared with preterm formula (PF), mother's milk (MM) is associated with lower rates of late-onset sepsis (LOS) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) among premature infants. Because not all mothers of premature infants produce sufficient milk to supply their infants throughout hospitalization, we reasoned that pasteurized donor human milk (DM) would be a suitable alternative.

   METHODS: Extremely premature infants (<30 weeks of gestation) whose mothers intended to breastfeed were assigned randomly to receive either pasteurized DM or PF if the supply of their own MM became insufficient during the study (birth to 90 days of age or hospital discharge). Infection-related events (LOS, NEC, meningitis, presumed sepsis, or urinary tract infection) that occurred after the attainment of a milk intake of 50 mL/kg, dietary intake, growth, skin-to-skin contact, and duration of hospital stay were compared. The primary analysis compared groups DM and PF on an intent-to-treat basis. If no differences were noted, then these groups were combined and compared with the reference group, group MM. If differences were noted, then the subsequent analyses compared each group with group MM.

   RESULTS: Of 243 infants, 70 (29%) received only MM; group DM included 81 infants and group PF included 92 infants. Because of poor weight gain, 17 infants (21%), all in group DM, were switched to PF. There were no differences in birth weight, gestational age, multiple births, and age at attainment of feeding of 50 mL/kg among groups. There were no differences between group DM and group PF in LOS and/or NEC, other infection-related events, hospital stay, or number of deaths. Group DM received a greater intake of milk and more nutritional supplements but had a slower rate of weight gain, compared with group PF. Compared with groups DM and PF, group MM had fewer episodes of LOS and/or NEC and total infection-related events and a shorter duration of hospital stay. Group MM also had fewer Gram-negative organisms isolated from blood cultures than did the other groups.

   CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized, blinded trial of feeding of extremely premature infants, we found that, as a substitute for MM, DM offered little observed short-term advantage over PF for feeding extremely premature infants. Advantages to an exclusive diet of MM were observed in terms of fewer infection-related events and shorter hospital stays.

Title
  Holding the very low birth weight infant: skin-to-skin techniques. [Review] [30 refs]
Abstract
  Skin-to-skin holding has been reported as a valuable intervention for preterm infants for over a decade. However, many neonatal intensive care units are not practicing this therapy and cite lack of protocols and techniques as a barrier. This article describes in detail the nursing considerations and techniques involved to successfully implement skin-to-skin holding for very low birth weight, technology-dependent infants. NICU protocols can be derived from this article. [References: 30]

Title
  Interventions to prevent hypothermia at birth in preterm and/or low birthweight babies. [Review] [98 refs]
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Hypothermia incurred during routine postnatal resuscitation is a world-wide issue (across all climates), with associated morbidity and mortality. Keeping vulnerable preterm infants warm is problematic even when recommended routine thermal care guidelines are followed in the delivery suite.

   OBJECTIVES: To assess efficacy and safety of interventions, designed for prevention of hypothermia in preterm and/or low birthweight infants, applied within 10 minutes after birth in the delivery suite compared with routine thermal care.

   SEARCH STRATEGY: The standard search strategy of The Cochrane Collaboration was followed. Electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE (1966 to May Week 4 2004 ), CINAHL (1982 to May Week 4 2004), EMBASE (1974 to 09/07/04), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2004), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE 1994 to July 2004), conference/symposia proceedings using ZETOC (1993 to July 2004), ISI proceedings (1990 to 09/07/2004) and OCLC WorldCat (July 2004). Identified articles were cross-referenced. No language restrictions were imposed.

   SELECTION CRITERIA: All trials using randomised or quasi-randomised allocations to test a specific intervention designed to prevent hypothermia, (apart from 'routine' thermal care) applied within 10 minutes after birth in the delivery suite to infants of < 37 weeks' gestational age or birthweight </=2500 g.

   DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Methodological quality was assessed and data were extracted for important clinical outcomes including adverse effects of the intervention by at least three independent reviewers. Authors were contacted for missing data. Data were analysed using RevMan 4.2.5. Relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat (NNT) with 95% confidence limits were calculated for each dichotomous outcome and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence limits for continuous outcomes.

   MAIN RESULTS: Six studies giving a total of 304 infants randomised and 295 completing the studies were included. Four comparisons to 'routine care' were undertaken within two categories: 1) barriers to heat loss (four studies): plastic wrap or bag (three), stockinet caps (one) and 2) external heat sources (two studies): skin-to-skin (one), transwarmer mattress (one). Plastic barriers were effective in reducing heat losses in infants < 28 weeks' gestation (three studies, n = 159; WMD 0.76 degrees C; 95% CI 0.49, 1.03) but not in the 28 to 31 week group. There was insufficient evidence to suggest that plastic wrap reduces the risk of death within hospital stay (three studies, n = 161; typical RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.32, 1.22; typical RD -0.09; 95% CI -0.20, 0.03). There was no evidence of a significant difference in major brain injury, mean duration of oxygen therapy or hospitalisation for infants < 29 weeks' gestation. Stockinet caps were not effective (borderline significant for infants < 2000 g birthweight) in reducing heat losses.Skin-to-skin care was shown to be effective in reducing the risk of hypothermia when compared to conventional incubator care for infants 1200 to 2199 g birthweight (one study, n = 31; RR 0.09; 95% CI 0.01, 0.64; NNT 2; 2 to 4). The transwarmer mattress significantly kept infants </=1500 g warmer and reduced the incidence of hypothermia on admission to NICU (one study, n = 24; RR 0.30; 95% CI 0.11, 0.83; NNT 2 range 2 to 4).

   AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Plastic wraps or bags, skin-to-skin care and transwarmer mattresses all keep preterm infants warmer, leading to higher temperatures on admission to neonatal units and less hypothermia. Given the low NNT, consideration should be given to using these interventions in the delivery suite. However, the small numbers of infants and studies and the absence of long term follow-up mean that firm recommendations for clinical practice cannot be given. There is a need to conduct large, high quality randomised controlled trials looking at long-term outcomes. [References: 98]

Title
  [Nonpharmacologic management of pain in neonates]. [Review] [44 refs] [French]
Abstract
  It has taken a staggering amount of time for the medical community to realize that new-borns are able to feel pain. The treatment of neonatal pain during procedures has become mandatory, not only for humanitarian reasons which could alone justify the soothing of pain in these infants but also because repeated and prolonged pain may have long-term consequences in neonates. Nonpharmacological interventions which comprise environmental and behavioral interventions have a wide applicability for neonatal pain management alone or in combination with pharmacological treatments. These interventions are not necessarily substitutes or alternatives for pharmacological interventions but are complimentary. Nonpharmacological interventions can reduce neonatal pain indirectly by reducing the total amount of noxious stimuli to which infants are exposed and directly, by blocking nociceptive transduction or transmission or activation of descending inhibitory pathways or by activating attention and arousal systems that modulate pain. This article describes prevention, environmental interventions, and behavioral strategies. Within the behavioral strategies, sweet solutions, especially sucrose and glucose, with or without non-nutritive sucking, skin to skin contact, and breastfeeding during procedures have been studied and their analgesic efficacy has been shown. A practical approach is described hereafter. Give 1-2 ml of oral sucrose or glucose 30% at 2 min before a minor painful procedures in term neonates or neonates weighing more than 2500 g. The analgesic efficacy of sucrose and glucose seems similar. For preterm neonates weighing less than 2500 g, give 0.5 ml of oral sucrose or glucose 30%, and for those weighing less than 1500 g, 0.3 ml of oral sucrose or glucose 30%. Since a synergistic effect has been shown for the association of sweet solutions and pacifiers, give a pacifier together with sweet solutions. For term neonates that are breastfed, consider breastfeeding during procedures. These nonpharmacological interventions are suitable for minor procedures. They should not constitute the sole analgesic when performing more invasive procedures. [References: 44]

Title
  Pain management in neonates. [Review] [117 refs]
Abstract
  Multiple lines of evidence suggest an increased sensitivity to pain in neonates. Repeated and prolonged pain exposure may affect the subsequent development of pain systems, as well as potentially contribute to alterations in long-term development and behavior. Despite impressive gains in the knowledge of neonatal pain mechanisms and strategies to treat neonatal pain acquired during the last 15 years, a large gap still exists between routine clinical practice and research results. Accurate assessment of pain is crucial for effective pain management in neonates. Neonatal pain management should rely on current scientific evidence more than the attitudes and beliefs of care-givers. Parents should be informed of pain relief strategies and their participation in the health care plan to alleviate pain should be encouraged. The need for systemic analgesia for both moderate and severe pain, in conjunction with behavioral/environmental approaches to pain management, is emphasized. A main sources of pain in the neonate is procedural pain which should always be prevented and treated. Nonpharmacological approaches constitute important treatment options for managing procedural pain. Nonpharmacological interventions (environmental and preventive measures, non-nutritive sucking, sweet solutions, skin-skin contact, and breastfeeding analgesia) can reduce neonatal pain indirectly by reducing the total amount of noxious stimuli to which infants are exposed, and directly, by blocking nociceptive transduction or transmission or by activation of descending inhibitory pathways or by activating attention and arousal systems that modulate pain. Opioids are the mainstay of pharmacological pain treatment but there are other useful medications and techniques that may be used for pain relief. National guidelines are necessary to improve neonatal pain management at the institutional level, individual neonatal intensive care units need to develop specific practice guidelines regarding pain treatment to ensure that all staff are familiar with the effects of the drugs being used and to guarantee access and safe administration of pain treatment to all neonates.

Title
  Bradycardia and desaturation during skin-to-skin care: no relationship to hyperthermia.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: We recently found increased temperature and increased bradycardia and desaturation during skin-to-skin care (SSC). We wanted to determine if these effects were related.

   STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-two infants (median gestational age at birth 28.5 weeks [range 24-31], median age at study 25.5 days [range 10-60 days], median birth weight 1025 g [range 550-1525 g], median weight at study 1320 g [range 900-2460 g]) underwent three 2-hour recordings of breathing movements, nasal airflow, heart rate, and pulse oximeter saturation (SpO 2 ): at thermoneutrality (TN) during incubator care, at TN during SSC, and at elevated temperature (ET) during incubator care. Core temperature was measured via a rectal probe. Recordings were analyzed for the summed rate of bradycardia and desaturation (heart rate <2/3 of baseline; SpO 2 <or=80%).

   RESULTS: Rectal temperature remained unchanged during SSC and increased by 0.6 degrees C during ET ( P < .001). The summed rate of bradycardia and desaturation was increased during SSC but not during ET (TN: median 2.2/hour (range, 0-19), ET: median 1.7/hour (range, 0-13), SSC: 3.0/hour (0-25), P < .02 SSC vs ET).

   CONCLUSION: Bradycardia and desaturation were increased during SSC, even at constant rectal temperature, whereas ET had no effect on these events. Moderate hyperthermia did not increase respiratory instability in preterm infants.

Title
  Early relationship environments: physiology of skin-to-skin contact for parents and their preterm infants. [Review] [79 refs]
Abstract
  Skin-to-skin care involves the mother placing her diaper-clad infant upright between her breasts in direct skin contact. The practice has evolved worldwide to be an intervention strategy in neonatal intensive care units for premature infants and their mothers. Few adverse outcomes have been noted in thermoregulation, cardiovascular changes, or behavioral organization. Findings have been positively related to better infant physiologic and neurobehavioral outcomes, maternal breastfeeding success, and positive attachment relationships. The early, intimate, and physiologically stabilizing benefits of skin-to-skin care provide for a new conceptualization of the optimal environment for preterm infants in intensive care.

Title
  Randomized controlled trial of skin-to-skin contact from birth versus conventional incubator for physiological stabilization in 1200- to 2199-gram newborns.
Abstract
  AIM: Conventional care of prematurely born infants involves extended maternal-infant separation and incubator care. Recent research has shown that separation causes adverse effects. Maternal-infant skin-to-skin contact (SSC) provides an alternative habitat to the incubator, with proven benefits for stable prematures; this has not been established for unstable or newborn low-birthweight infants. SSC from birth was therefore compared to incubator care for infants between 1200 and 2199 g at birth.

   METHODS: This was a prospective, unblinded, randomized controlled clinical trial; potential subjects were identified before delivery and randomized by computerized minimization technique at 5 min if eligible. Standardized care and observations were maintained for 6 h. Stability was measured in terms of a set of pre-determined physiological parameters, and a composite cardio-respiratory stabilization score (SCRIP).

   RESULTS: 34 infants were analysed in comparable groups: 3/18 SSC compared to 12/13 incubator babies exceeded the pre-determined parameters (p < 0.001). Stabilization scores were 77.11 for SSC versus 74.23 for incubator (maximum 78), mean difference 2.88 (95% CI: 0.3-5.46, p = 0.031). All 18 SSC subjects were stable in the sixth hour, compared to 6/13 incubator infants. Eight out of 13 incubator subjects experienced hypothermia.

   CONCLUSION: Newborn care provided by skin-to-skin contact on the mother's chest results in better physiological outcomes and stability than the same care provided in closed servo-controlled incubators. The cardio-respiratory instability seen in separated infants in the first 6 h is consistent with mammalian "protest-despair" biology, and with "hyper-arousal and dissociation" response patterns described in human infants: newborns should not be separated from their mothers.

Title
  Stratum corneum maturation. A review of neonatal skin function. [Review] [102 refs]
Abstract
  The importance of the stratum corneum and its barrier function for infants, especially for newborns, is clinically evident. Research regarding the maturation of the stratum corneum in neonates, i.e. when full barrier function is obtained, has produced varying results. Based on transepidermal water loss and percutaneous absorption studies, term infants seem to possess stratum corneum with adult barrier properties. Additionally, postnatal life is thought to accelerate stratum corneum maturation, so that even preterm infants have barrier function similar to term infants at 2-3 weeks of gestational age. However, a look at other parameters, such as skin thickness, skin pH and stratum corneum hydration, shows that neonatal skin is always adjusting to the extrauterine environment in contrast to the steady state of adult skin. This suggests that barrier stabilization may be dependent on achieving a balance between different parameters. However, it is still in question, which parameters, what balance and what timing. This paper provides an up-to-date overview on the neonatal skin barrier based on the review of current literature. Copyright 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel [References: 102]

  [Encouraging mother-child attachment in premature situations: nursing interventions at the Ribeirao Preto clinical hospital]. [Portuguese]
Abstract
  This study aims at describing nursing actions performed in the high-risk neonatal units at a university hospital of the University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao Preto so as to favor mother-child attachment in prematurity situations. The nurse accompanies parents in their first visit, giving them support as well as information concerning the equipment surrounding the newborn and encouraging skin-to-skin contact, touching and talking. Parents' access to and staying with high-risk newborns is permanently allowed. A visiting program by grandparents and siblings of pre-term newborns was implemented, even when under intensive care, which encourages family contact. Parents participate in a support group with other parents who experienced the situation of having their pre-term children in serious conditions and hospitalized. We consider that our experience has favored the establishment of mother-child and family attachment, observing greater interaction between the family and the newborn, particular involving the mother. Greater interest in learning about care as well as satisfaction concerning the assistance received have also been expressed by families.

Title
  Somatic growth of preterm infants during skin-to-skin care versus traditional holding: a randomized, controlled trial.
Abstract
  We performed this randomized trial to determine whether infants receiving skin-to-skin care (SSC) grew more rapidly and had a shorter duration of hospital stay compared with infants held by their parents in a traditional way. Infants who met eligibility criteria (<or=32 wk of gestation, <or=1500 g, minimal ventilatory support, and hemodynamically stable) were randomized to traditional holding (TH) or SSC groups. Parents in both groups were allowed to hold infants for a total of 8 hours per day (periods of up to 4 hr, twice/d). During the study, infants in the TH group were held 4.8 +/- 3.5 times per week and 76 +/- 39 minutes per day, and infants in the SSC group were held 4.0 +/- 2.8 times per week and 79 +/- 40 minutes per day. No significant differences were observed in weight accretion or linear growth. However, exposure to SSC was associated with greater head growth, even after controlling for head circumference at birth (p =.03). SSC may increase the likelihood of successful breastfeeding.

  Linezolid: in infants and children with severe Gram-positive infections. [Review] [71 refs]
Abstract
  Linezolid is an oxazolidinone antibacterial agent that has inhibitory activity against a broad range of Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The systemic clearance and, therefore, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and elimination half-life of linezolid change with increasing age in pediatric patients. With the exception of pre-term neonates aged <1 week, systemic clearance is more rapid in pediatric patients aged 0-11 years than in adolescents. The pharmacokinetic profile of linezolid is similar in adolescents and adults. Linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of pediatric patients with Gram-positive infections (clinical cure rate 89.3% vs 84.5%), and as effective as cefadroxil in the treatment of children and adolescents with Gram-positive uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (91.0% vs 90.0%) in the clinically evaluable population of two randomized, comparator-controlled trials. The clinical cure rate with linezolid was 92.4% in a noncomparative trial in hospitalized pediatric patients with community-acquired pneumonia. All patients with proven pneumococcal pneumonia were considered cured. Linezolid is generally well tolerated. The most common drug-related adverse events in the comparator-controlled trials were diarrhea, nausea, and headache; most events were mild to moderate in severity. [References: 71]

  [Breast is best--human milk for premature infants]. [Review] [35 refs] [Hebrew]
Abstract
  Nutrition for preterm babies is aimed at achieving expected intrauterine growth and accretion of nutrients. Early trophic feedings should be started as soon as possible for gastrointestinal priming. Mother's (breast) milk is the best food for preterm babies. Its advantages are in host defence, nutritional components and suitability for gut absorption, as well as its psychological and developmental value. The limitations of human milk for preterm babies, mainly in protein and minerals, can be compensated for by using powdered human milk fortifier. Sucking skills usually mature around 34 weeks, corrected gestational age. Thus, small preemies are initially fed by orogastric tubes, meaning that expressed breast milk is used. Support of lactation in mothers of preemies mandates protection of the mother and child bonding process and early skin to skin contact ("kangeroo care"). Methods for storage of expressed breast milk and the recommended length of storage are discussed. Milk bank mandates pasteurization and freezing of the donors' milk. Most of the nutritional and immunological advantages of human milk are preserved after such treatments. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections in preterm infants, that were acquired from mother's expressed breast milk, are not uncommon, and require further attention. [References: 35]

Title
  Heart period variability of intubated very-low-birth-weight infants during incubator care and maternal holding.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Heart rate has been used to measure infants' physiological stability during skin-to-skin holding. Variability in heart period (interbeat interval), a more sensitive measure of autonomic nervous system tone, has not.

   OBJECTIVE: To describe heart period variability in intubated very-low-birth-weight infants during incubator care and during maternal skin-to-skin holding.

   DESIGN/METHODS: An experimental, interrupted time series, crossover design was used; infants served as their own controls. Infants were randomly assigned to treatment order: 2 hours of intermittent skin-to-skin holding for 2 consecutive days followed by 2 days of incubator care or vice versa. The analog signal representing heart period was sampled and quantized at 5 Hz via a dedicated computer system in multiple 300-second epochs each day.

   RESULTS: Fourteen infants with similar characteristics completed the protocol. The mean interbeat interval was 332 ms during skin-to-skin care and 368 ms during incubator care. Power within the low- and high-frequency regions of heart period was not significantly different between skin-to-skin holding and incubator care. Mean low-frequency power was 124.6 ms2 during skin-to-skin holding and ranged from 51.9 ms2 to 71.4 ms2 during all periods of incubator care. Mean high-frequency power was similar during skin-to-skin holding and incubator care (8.8 ms2 and 6.1 ms2). Infants of 32 to 34 weeks' corrected gestational age had increased power in the low- and high-frequency regions.

   CONCLUSIONS: Heart period variability did not improve during skin-to-skin holding. Gestationally older infants had increased power in the low- and high-frequency regions, suggesting a maturing autonomic nervous system.

Title
  Orthogonal polarization spectral imaging (OPS): a novel method to measure the microcirculation in term and preterm infants transcutaneously.
Abstract
  Little is known about the microvascular perfusion of the skin postnatally. Skin microvascular parameters can be assessed noninvasively with orthogonal polarization spectral imaging (OPS), a technique where, through the use of special optics, a virtual light source is created at a depth of 1 mm within the tissue. The light is absorbed by the Hb, yielding an image of the illuminated Hb-carrying structures in negative contrast. In nine term (weight 2100-4470 g) and 28 preterm infants (weight 550-2070 g; gestational age 24-33 wk) red blood cell velocity and vessel diameter and density were determined off-line with the Cap-Image program in vessels video-recorded by OPS near the axilla on d 1 and 5 of life. Blood pressure, heart rate, hematocrit, and body and incubator temperature were noted. Vessel diameter ranged from 6 to 24 microm, vessel density from 219 to 340 cm/cm(2) with no change between d 1 or 5 and no difference between term and preterm infants. Red blood cell velocity increased in preterm infants from d 1 [median 528 microm/s, 95% confidence interval (CI) 486-564 microm/s] to d 5 (median 570 microm/s; 95% CI 548-662 microm/s; p = 0.001) and correlated with the decrease in median hematocrit from 44% (CI 40%-60%) to 39% (CI 37%-43%) with r(2) = -0.37 with a 95% CI -0.59 to -0.11, p = 0.006. Hematocrit correlates with red blood cell velocity in the microvessels of the skin. The new technology can be used to assess quantitative changes in the microvessels and thus allows noninvasive assessment of tissue perfusion in term and preterm infants.

Title
  A comparison of the safety of cupfeedings and bottlefeedings in premature infants whose mothers intend to breastfeed.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety of cupfeeding, an alternative feeding method, to bottlefeeding, the current standard of artificial feeding in the United States, in preterm infants whose mothers intend to breastfeed.

   STUDY DESIGN: In a prospective, randomized crossover study, 56 infants <or=34 weeks at birth, whose mothers indicated a desire to breastfeed, were studied. Skin-to-skin care and attempts at breast were encouraged frequently when babies were physiologically stable. When infants were >or=34 weeks' corrected gestational age, the order of the first two non-breast oral feedings was randomized by coin toss to one cupfeeding and one bottlefeeding. Trained Neonatal Intensive Care Unit nurses provided the feedings. Heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were recorded at 1-minute intervals for 10 minutes before and during the feeding. Volume taken, time required to complete the feed, and any apnea, bradycardia, choking, or spitting episodes were recorded.

   RESULTS: Heart rate (p<0.0001) and respiratory rate (p<0.0001) increased and oxygen saturation decreased (p=0.0002) during both cup and bottlefeedings compared to pre-feeding baselines. The amount of change in these three parameters from baseline to feeding period was similar for both feeding methods. The fraction of O(2) saturation <90% during baseline compared to the study period was different between these two feeding methods (p=0.02). There was a 10-fold increase in desaturations <90% during bottlefeeds compared to no change during cupfeeds. When comparing cupfeeding periods to bottlefeeding periods, heart rates were higher (p=0.009) and oxygen saturations lower (p=0.02) during bottlefeeds. There were no differences between methods in respiratory rate, choking, spitting or apnea, and bradycardia. Volumes taken were lower (p=0.001) and duration of feeds longer (p=0.002) during cupfeedings.

   CONCLUSION: During cupfeedings, premature infants are more physiologically stable, with lower heart rates, higher oxygen saturations, and less desaturations, than during bottlefeedings. However, cupfed infants took less volume, over more time, than bottlefed for these initial feedings. Based on better physiologic stability and no difference in untoward effects, cupfeeding is at least as safe, if not safer, than bottlefeeding in this population. This study supports the use of cupfeeding as a safe alternative feeding method for premature infants learning to breastfeed.

Title
  The use of human milk for premature infants. [Review] [70 refs]
Abstract
  Various methods have been reported and used clinically to augment the nutrient supply for human milk-fed premature infants. These methods include specialized maltinutrient powdered mixtures (fortifiers), complete liquid formulas designed to be mixed with human milk, complete powdered formulas to be mixed with human milk, and alternate feeding of human milk and preterm formula. Although the optimum nutrition of premature infants is unknown, data are accumulating to suggest that human milk, fortified with additional nutrients, is appropriate for tube-fed infants. The use of fortified human milk typically provides premature infants adequate growth, nutrient retention, and biochemical indices of nutritional status when fed at approximately 180 mL/kg/d compared with unfortified human milk. Data are needed to determine the precise quantity of nutrients to be added as supplements. Nutrient interactions have not been explored in detail. Although large quantities of calcium seem to be needed, the exogenous calcium may affect fat absorption adversely. Manipulation of milk may affect the intrinsic host-defense properties of the milk. Compared with preterm formula, the feeding of fortified human milk may provide significant protection from infection and NEC. Lastly, the potential stimulation of an enteromammary pathway through skin-to-skin contact provides species-specific antimicrobial protection for premature infants. Several of these areas require additional exploration. Thus, for premature infants, neonatal centers should encourage the feeding of fortified human milk, together with skin-to-skin contact, as reasonable methods to enhance milk production while potentially facilitating the development of an enteromammary response.

Title
  [The "Kangaroo" ward]. [Review] [0 refs] [Polish]
Abstract
  The "Kangaroo mother" is a symbol of gentle care for the newborn in continuous closeness with his/her mother. This concept was for the first time introduced to neonatal care in Columbia as a way of compensating for technical and personnel shortages. In France, the first Kangaroo ward was established in the academic hospital in Clamart, near Paris in 1987. This ward is designed for premature babies of gestational age of more than 31 weeks and with birth weight more than 1500 g as well as for newborns with non-life threatening conditions and not requiring intensive care. Handling the child, skin-to-skin contact and breast-feeding are not treated as therapeutic means but as important elements of the relationship between the child and his/her parents. The author discusses in detail the organisation of care in the Kangaroo ward and analyses its advantages and disadvantages for both parents and the medical staff. Apart from providing continuous contact between the mother and the child, the important advantages of this system of care are: less maternal anxiety, well-being of the child, more efficient participation of mothers in caring for their children. The role of the paediatrician in perinatal care is stressed and the principles of neonatal organisation are discussed. [References: 0]

Title
  Characterization of vernix caseosa as a natural biofilm: comparison to standard oil-based ointments.
Abstract
  The application of occlusive films and oil-in-oil ointments has been reported to improve epidermal barrier function in very low birthweight, preterm infants. Such infants have a structurally immature stratum corneum and lack a surface coating of vernix caseosa. In this study we examined the short-term effects of topical application of vernix caseosa to human skin and contrasted these effects with commonly used ointments and water-in-oil emulsions. Specifically, vernix, Eucerin(R), Aquaphor(R), and petrolatum were applied to the volar skin surface of adult volunteers. Surface electrical capacitance (SEC) and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) were measured as indices of surface hydration. Sorption-desorption profiles were performed to determine skin surface hydrophobicity. Particular attention was given to monitoring the acute (0-120 minutes) changes following vernix treatment in order to compare these effects with earlier reports on the rate of skin surface drying in newborn infants following birth. Immediately after vernix application there was an increase in the rate of water loss from the skin surface. Relative to control skin and skin treated with the ointments and water-in-oil emulsions, the application of vernix to freshly bathed human skin resulted in a unique profile of temporal change in baseline surface hydration, moisture accumulation, and water-holding capacity. These results demonstrate major differences between human vernix and standard oil-based topical ointments. The results provide a framework for discussing the various properties of topical barriers applied to the very low birthweight infant.

Title
  The impact of two transfer techniques used during skin-to-skin care on the physiologic and behavioral responses of preterm infants.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Conservation of energy assumes an important role in the care of infants requiring assisted ventilation, yet little research has been conducted on this group of infants in terms of thermoregulation, oxygenation, heart rate, or sleep states during skin-to-skin care.

   OBJECTIVES: To compare the impact of two different transfer techniques used in skin-to-skin care (nurse transfer and parent transfer) on physiologic stability and other descriptive measures of physiologic stability related to energy conservation in ventilated preterm infants during and after skin-to-skin care.

   METHOD: Fifteen ventilated preterm infants weighing a mean of 1,094 g were randomly assigned to receive either parent or nurse-to-parent transfer on the first of 2 consecutive days and the alternate method the following day. Temperature was taken before and after skin-to-skin care. Oxygen saturation and heart rate were recorded minute by minute, and the Assessment of Behavioral Systems Observation (ABSO) scale scores was used to measure physiologic organization, motor organization, self-regulation, and need for caregiver facilitation during transfer to and from the parent and during pre, post, and skin-to-skin periods.

   RESULTS: Temperature remained stable. Oxygen saturation decreased and heart rate increased when the infant was transferred to and from the parent, but returned to baseline levels during and after skin-to-skin care regardless of the transfer method. Infants showed more physiologic and motor disorganization, less self-regulation, and more need for caregiver facilitation during transfers to and from the parent than during the pre, post, and skin-to-skin care periods.

   CONCLUSIONS: Both transfer methods resulted in physiologic disorganization. However, during and after skin-to-skin care, infants exhibited no signs of energy depletion.

Title
  Skin-to-skin contact improves gas exchange in premature infants.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: Skin-to-skin contact (kangarooing) is regarded as an important method to improve intensive care in premature infants. There is still demand for investigations of its impact on physiological parameters.

   STUDY DESIGN: We examined 53 preterm infants of < 1800 gm in a prospective, pretest-test-posttest design study during incubator care (60 minutes), skin-to-skin contact (90 minutes), and incubator care again (90 minutes). Heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation (SaO2), transcutaneous pO2 (tcpO2), transcutaneous pCO2, rectal temperature, and fraction of inspired oxygen were measured.

   RESULTS: The heart rate increased during skin-to-skin contact by 5 beats per minute (p < 0.001), the respiratory rate dropped by 5/minute (p < 0.01), the SaO2 improved by 0.4% (p < 0.05) accompanied by an increase of tcpO2 of 4.8 mm Hg (p < 0.001), the tcpCO2 dropped by 1.2 mm Hg (p < 0.001), and the rectal temperature increased by 0.3 degree C (p < 0.001). Analyzing three groups separately by postnatal weight, we observed the smallest increase in heart rate and the highest decrease in respiratory rate in infants of < 1000 gm (p < 0.001). The increase in SaO2 and in the tcpO2 doubles in infants of < 1000 gm compared with infants of > 1000 gm (p < 0.001). All changes were independent of postnatal age.

   CONCLUSION: During skin-to-skin contact, preterm infants not only remain clinically stable but also show a more efficient gas exchange. Although the patient is removed (transferred) from the incubator, there is no risk of hypothermia even in infants of < 1000 gm.

Title
  The effect of application of aquaphor on skin condition, fluid requirements, and bacterial colonization in very low birth weight infants.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of repeated application of an occlusive ointment on the skin of very low birth weight infants.

   STUDY DESIGN: Nineteen neonates of 26 to 30 weeks gestational age were randomly assigned to receive topical Aquaphor ointment twice daily for 2 weeks or to receive standard skin care. Skin quality, fluid requirements, and skin bacterial colonization counts were assessed.

   RESULTS: Infants treated with Aquaphor had significantly improved skin condition scores versus controls (p = 0.002). Aquaphor improved skin scores over time (p = 0.012) in treated infants, whereas skin scores of untreated infants worsened before eventually healing. There were no significant differences in total fluid requirements, urine output, serum sodium concentrations, skin bacterial counts, fungal counts, or colonization patterns between treated and control infants in either gestational age cohort.

   CONCLUSION: Aquaphor ointment, used during the first two postnatal weeks, improved skin condition in infants of 26 to 30 weeks' gestation without changing skin bacterial flora. We speculate that improved skin condition may limit transepidermal water loss and decrease portals of entry for pathogens, thereby potentially decreasing fluid and electrolyte imbalances and sepsis in very low birth weight infants.

Title
  [How do mothers experience skin contact with their very immature (gestational age 27-30 weeks), only days old premature infants?]. [German]
Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Mothers are offered skin-to-skin contact with their preterm infants with the intention to promote bonding. But it is not known if the mother of a very immature fragile infant perceives skin-to-skin contact as a helpful intervention or a stressful situation.

   PATIENTS AND METHODS: Mothers of singleton preterm infants (gestational age 27-30 weeks) began skin-to-skin contact as soon as the infant was breathing spontaneously. They prospectively documented frequency and duration of skin-to-skin contact, they rated their anxiety or confidence and their attachment to the infant and described their observations of the infant daily for 14 days in a semi-structured questionnaire.

   RESULTS: 17 of 25 mother-infant-pairs in the observation period fulfilled the entry criteria, 14 questionnaires about 196 skin-to-skin periods could be analyzed (median gestational age 27.5 weeks (27-30), median birth weight 1130 g (695-1300). Skin-to-skin contact began at a median age of 3 days [2-7]. The median duration of the skin-to-skin periods was increased at maternal request from 60 to 120 minutes between day 1 and 14 (p = 0.004). Even then 21% of the mothers wanted a still longer duration of skin-to-skin contact. Mothers reported anxiety only 5 times. 82% of the mothers reported positive own feelings during skin-to-skin contact and 78% felt that skin-to-skin contact increased their attachment to their infant.

   CONCLUSION: The mothers studied perceived skin-to-skin contact with their very immature infants as a positive and helpful intervention. Skin-to-skin contact took place regularly and for increasing periods of time.

Title
  Effects of skin-to-skin holding on general movements of preterm infants.
Abstract
  The study objective was to test the hypothesis that the effect of skin-to-skin (STS) holding increases the ratio of rest to activity in low birth weight preterm infants. Ten infants with birthweight < 2,000 grams were videotaped before and after STS holding. Video recordings were analyzed to determine the number of general movements. We found no statistically significant difference between the percentage of general movements over the two periods. We conclude that the ratio of rest-activity before and after STS holding does not change as measured by occurrence of general movements.

Title
  The use of human milk and breastfeeding in premature infants. [Review] [118 refs]
Abstract
  Human milk is beneficial in the management of premature infants. The beneficial effects generally relate to improvements in host defenses, digestion, and absorption of nutrients, gastrointestinal function, neurodevelopment, and maternal psychological well-being. The use of fortified human milk generally provides the premature infant adequate growth, nutrient retention, and biochemical indices of nutritional status when fed at approximately 180 mL/kg/day compared with unfortified human milk. Human milk can only support the needs of the premature infant if adequate milk volumes are produced. Intensive efforts at lactation support are desirable. Therefore, neonatal centers should encourage the feeding of fortified human milk for premature infants along with skin-to-skin contact as a reasonable method to enhance milk production and promote success with early breastfeeding, while potentially facilitating the development of an enteromammary response.

Title
  Parents' perception of skin-to-skin care with their preterm infants requiring assisted ventilation.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To explore parents' perception of skin-to-skin care with their preterm infant who is on assisted ventilation, and to elucidate factors influencing the decision to continue or discontinue skin-to-skin care.

   DESIGN: Naturalistic inquiry, using open-ended, transcribed and audiotaped face-to-face and telephone interviews.

   SETTING: Tertiary neonatal care setting and homes of parents.

   PARTICIPANTS: Eight mothers and one father who participated in skin-to-skin care.

   INTERVENTIONS: Two 60-minute skin-to-skin care sessions.

   RESULTS: Three themes emerged: (a) ambivalence of parents toward skin-to-skin care, including subthemes of yearning to hold the infant and apprehension to do so; (b) need of a supportive environment; and (c) special quality of the parent-infant interaction, including subthemes of intense connectedness and active parenting. Perceptions of apprehension, need for a supportive environment, and active parenting differed between parents who continued skin-to-skin care during their infants' hospitalization and parents who did not. Three of the four parents who discontinued skin-to-skin care in the hospital resumed when their infants were home.

   CONCLUSIONS: Differences in narratives of parents highlighted the importance of individualizing the skin-to-skin experience to the needs of parent and infant. Parents who resumed skin-to-skin care at home valued the experience while their infant was hospitalized but needed intervention to alleviate their apprehension, enhance their feeling of autonomy, and modify the environment.

Title
  The role of human milk fortification for premature infants. [Review] [69 refs]
Abstract
  This article focuses on the current experience with the use of fortified milk in feeding premature infants. The use of fortified human milk provides the premature infant adequate growth, nutrient retention, and biochemical indices of nutritional status when fed at approximately 180 mL/kg/d compared with unfortified human milk. When compared with preterm formula, the feeding of fortified human milk may provide significant protection from infection and necrotizing enterocolitis. Neonatal centers should encourage the feeding of fortified milk for premature infants. Skin-to-skin contact is a reasonable method to enhance milk production while potentially facilitating the development of an enteromammary response. [References: 69]

Title
  Noninvasive estimation of serum bilirubin.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and clinical usefulness of a new computer-driven, hand-held device (Chromatics Colormate III) to estimate serum bilirubin from skin-reflectance (skin color) of neonates.

   STUDY DESIGN: A total of 2441 infants (both term and premature) at two hospitals had repeated measurements of transcutaneous bilirubin. Of these infants, 900 had one or more laboratory determinations of serum bilirubin. Many of the infants had early measurements of skin color before the onset of jaundice. A visual estimate of the degree of jaundice was made by a health care worker when the laboratory study was drawn. A subgroup of 61 infants was also studied while undergoing phototherapy with a total of 284 comparisons obtained. The reproducibility of the instrument was assessed separately using standardized color tiles and repeated measurements by multiple operators.

   RESULTS: The range of serum bilirubin measurements that had concurrent skin color measurements was 3.22 to 338.1 micromol/L (0.2 to 21 mg/dL). The linear regression indicated an r = 0.956, and 95% of the skin color measurements were within 32.2 micromol/L (2.0 mg/dL). There was no interference with the accuracy of the device because of infant race or weight, or because of the use of phototherapy. The device provided reproducible information when infants were tested repeatedly over 30 minutes; the coefficient of variation for the transcutaneous bilirubin measurement was 3.1% around a mean estimate of 135.32 micromol/L (8.4 mg/dL).

   CONCLUSION: The Chromatics Colormate III allows for a clinically useful estimate of serum bilirubin in a wide variety of infants. By using a color discrimination algorithm and obtaining a skin measurement before the onset of icterus, this instrument can provide valuable clinical information that obviates the need for serum bilirubin determinations. Its use in newborn nurseries may allow physicians to shorten length of stay more safely and decrease the use of invasive blood tests.

Title
  Effects of gestational and postnatal age on body temperature, oxygen consumption, and activity during early skin-to-skin contact between preterm infants of 25-30-week gestation and their mothers.
Abstract
  Temporary skin-to-skin contact between preterm infant and the mother is increasingly used in neonatal medicine to promote bonding. It is not known at which gestational age (GA) and postnatal age skin-to-skin contact outside the incubator is a sufficiently warm environment and is tolerated by preterm infants without a decrease in body temperature, oxygen consumption (VO2) increase, or unrest. We conducted a prospective clinical study of 27 spontaneously breathing preterm infants of 25-30-wk GA. Rectal temperature (Trecta), VO2 (indirect calorimetry), and activity were continuously measured in the incubator (60 min), during skin-to-skin contact (60 min), and back in the incubator (60 min) in wk 1 and 2 of life. In wk 1 the change in Trectal during skin-to-skin contact was related to GA (r=0.585, p=0.0027): infants of 25-27-wk GA lost heat during skin-to-skin contact, whereas infants of 28-30 wk gained heat and their mean Trectal during skin-to-skin contact was 0.3 degrees C higher than before (p < 0.01). No significant changes of VO2 or activity occurred. In wk 2 the infants' VO2 was higher than in wk 1, but VO2 during skin-to-skin contact was the same as in the incubator. Only small fluctuations in Trectal occurred. In wk 2 all infants slept more during skin-to-skin contact than in the incubator (p < 0.02). We conclude that, for preterm infants of 28-30-wk GA, skin-to-skin contact was a sufficiently warm environment as early as postnatal wk 1. For infants of 25-27-wk GA skin-to-skin contact should be postponed until wk 2 of life, when their body temperature remains stable and they are more quiet during skin-to-skin contact than in the incubator.

Title
  Skin-to-skin parental contact with fragile preterm infants.
Abstract
  Skin-to-skin contact has been implemented recently to facilitate maternal-infant bonding of preterm infants. The technique allows the removal of fragile preterm infants from an incubator to the bare chest of a parent or caretaker. When specific guidelines are followed, thermal stability can be maintained, parent-infant bonding can be facilitated, and parental satisfaction can be enhanced. We illustrate a case in which a preterm infant has skin-to-skin contact while being monitored for physiologic parameters, including heart and respiratory rate, oxyhemoglobin saturation, and nasal airflow. Improvements in breathing patterns in this infant during skin-to-skin care and maintenance of a normal temperature suggest that this technique may not only be safe and psychologically beneficial, but it may also promote physiologic improvement.

Title
  Skin-to-skin holding in the neonatal intensive care unit influences maternal milk volume.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of early initiation of skin-to-skin (STS) holding on lactation, we compared 24-hour milk volumes of mothers of ventilated low birth weight infants in an STS group to mothers in a non-STS control group.

   STUDY DESIGN: Mean 24-hour milk volumes at 2, 3, and 4 weeks after delivery of mothers participating in STS holding were compared with those of a retrospective control group from the 12-month period immediately preceding the introduction of STS holding in the neonatal intensive care unit. A repeated-measures analysis of variance adjusting for baseline volumes (1 week after delivery) was used to evaluate the difference in milk volumes between STS and control groups.

   RESULTS: Sixteen mothers initiated STS holding during the 2-month study period. Eight mothers met study criteria by initiating STS holding during the first 4 weeks after delivery. During a 2-week period the study group had a strong linear increase in milk volume in contrast to no indicative change of the control group's milk volume.

   CONCLUSION: STS holding of low birth weight infants initiated in the early intensive care phase can result in a significant increase in maternal milk volume, thereby overcoming the frequently seen insufficient lactation experienced by these mothers.

Title
  Parents' skin to skin holding of small premature infants: differences between fathers and mothers.
Abstract
  AIM: Both mothers and fathers should achieve early skin to skin holding of their small premature infants, despite the infants' need for breathing equipment, including respirator. If the mother needs to wait to hold her newborn due to her medical condition, this is not reason enough for the father also to wait.

   PURPOSE/QUESTION: Do fathers wait significantly longer post delivery to hold their small premature infants skin to skin (kangaroo) than mothers do?

   METHODS: Registration-schedule, existing sources of data, and interviews were used. FINDING/CONCLUSION: The time from birth (hours) until fathers held their small premature infants skin to skin was significantly different (p = 0.0004) compared to mothers. Fathers held their infants later than did mothers, despite the fact that fathers saw their infants before the mothers did. Compared to the mothers the average waiting time before fathers first held their infants skin to skin showed a difference of 120.9% (difference of the median).

Title
  Comparison of skin-to-skin contact with standard contact in low-birth-weight infants who are breast-fed.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of maternal-infant skin-to-skin contact (SSC) vs standard contact (SC) on low-birth-weight infants' physiological profile, maternal milk production, and duration of breast-feeding.

   DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, interventional study with cohort followed up for 6 months after discharge from the hospital.

   SETTING: Special care nursery with follow-up telephone calls after discharge from the hospital.

   PATIENTS: Fifty infants, with birth weights less than 1500 g and whose mothers planned to breast-feed, randomized to 2 groups: SSC (experimental) and SC (control).

   INTERVENTION: In the SSC group, infants were clothed in diaper and held upright between mothers' breasts; both mother and infant were covered with a blanket. In the SC group, infants were clothed, wrapped in blankets, and held cradled in mother's arms.

   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Infant physiological data, ie, oxygen saturation, heart rate, respiratory rate, and axillary temperature; maternal milk production; and duration of breast-feeding.

   RESULTS: Oxygen saturation was higher during SSC than during SC (P < .001); 11% of the oxygen saturation recordings during SSC vs 24% during SC indicated the values less than 90% (P < .001). A more stable milk production was noted in the SSC group. No differences were noted in infant temperature, heart rate, or respiratory rate. Ninety percent of mothers in the SSC group vs 61% in the SC group continued breast-feeding for the duration of the infants' hospitalization (P < .05), and 50% in the SSC group vs 11% in the SC continued breast-feeding through 1 month after discharge (P < .01).

   CONCLUSIONS: During SSC with their mothers, low-birth-weight infants maintain a higher oxygen saturation and are less likely to have desaturation to less than 90% oxygen than are infants exposed to SC. Mothers in the SSC group are more likely to continue breast-feeding until 1 month after discharge.

Title
  High-frequency ultrasound measurement of dermis and subcutaneous fat in the newborn infant.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND/AIMS: Skin thickness and subcutaneous fat thickness of newborn infants may reflect the condition of the infant including prematurity. Skin thickness and subcutaneous fat thickness might be useful parameters to characterize and monitor the nutritional state of the infant. The objective was to introduce ultrasonography for this purpose.

   METHODS: A high-frequency (20 MHz) ultrasound A-mode scanner was employed. Skinfold caliper recordings were performed for comparison. Frontal skin and skin of the back were studied in 7 infants with body weight 1095-4750 g (also studied with B-mode scanning). 46 infants weighing 925-4120 g were studied and correlated with skinfold recording.

   RESULTS: A high degree of correlation between skinfold recordings and ultrasound measurements (A-mode) of subcutaneous fat was found, coefficient of correlation 0.84, p<0.001.

   CONCLUSIONS: High-frequency ultrasound measurement of skin and subcutaneous fat thickness is precise and reliable for in vivo assessment of body fat in newborn infants. Further validation of the technique relative to neonatal skin and nutritional state is, however, needed before the ultrasound technique can be used as routine in neonatalogical monitoring.

Title
  Cannulation of the axillary artery in critically ill newborn infants.
Abstract
  UNLABELLED: The axillary artery has been successfully cannulated in critically ill adult and paediatric patients. There is little information about experience with this technique in neonates. We report the use of axillary cannulation in 62 mechanically ventilated neonates with birth weight from 750 to 3800 g (mean 1950 g). The axillary artery was catheterized with 24 or 22 gauge teflon catheters by means of the catheter-over-a-needle technique. Arterial access was used for blood pressure monitoring, blood sampling and in seven cases for blood removal during exchange transfusions. Cannulae were removed when the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) was less than 0.3. During cannulation capillary refill, radial artery pulse and neurological status of the arm were checked daily. The mean period of cannulation was 4.1 days (1-10 days). During cannulation and after catheter removal there were no complications related to the chosen vessel e.g. no change in the skin colour, skin warmth, capillary refill and the quality of the radial pulse. No changes in the motor activity of the limb on the cannulated side were observed.

   CONCLUSION: Axillary artery cannulation is a useful alternative for establishing an arterial access in ventilated neonates. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term consequences of this technique.

Title
  A physiologic method for monitoring premature infants. [Review] [16 refs]
Abstract
  Instrumentation capable of handling 12 continuous hours of nine-channel real-time physiologic data sampled at 10Hz was needed to test within and between subject variability and preterm infant responses to skin-to-skin contact with the mother. A review of basic electrical components, electrical principles related to physiologic monitoring, and electrophysiology concepts generic to physiologic monitoring is presented. The development, specifications and applications of a new instrument to monitor premature infant cardiorespiratory adaptations are discussed. [References: 16]

Title
  Rey-Martinez Kangaroo Mother Program: an alternative way of caring for low birth weight infants? One year mortality in a two cohort study.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of the Kangaroo mother intervention (KMI).

   DESIGN: Observational, analytic, prospective (two cohorts) study.

   SETTING: Two large tertiary care obstetric hospitals, one offering "traditional" care and the other KMI.

   PATIENTS: Newborn infants with birth weights < or = 2000 g, who survive the neonatal period and are eligible for an in-patient minimal care unit (MCU) (having overcome major adaptation problems to extra uterine life).

   INTERVENTIONS: "Kangaroo infants" (KI) were discharged as soon as they were eligible for MCU, regardless of weight or gestational age. Infants were kept 24 hours a day in an upright position, in skin-to-skin contact and firmly attached to the mother's chest until the KMI was not tolerated anymore. Control babies (from the other facility) were kept in incubators at the MCU until they satisfied usual discharge criteria for the control hospital. Both groups were followed periodically up to the age of 1 year.

   RESULTS: Three hundred thirty-two eligible infants were recruited, 162 at the Kangaroo hospital and 170 at the control hospital. KI came from a much lower socio-economic class and were more ill before eligibility. Relative risk of death was higher for KI (RR 1.9), although this figure was reversed after adjusting for weight at birth and gestational age (RR 0.5). KI grew less in the first 3 months and had a higher proportion of developmental delay at 1 year, and a multivariate analysis failed to control for the large baseline differences in socioeconomic levels and babies' health status between the two cohorts.

   CONCLUSIONS: In spite of major baseline differences between studied cohorts, the survival of LBW infants in Bogota is similar between the KMI and the "traditional care". Questions remain about quality of life, especially regarding weight gain and neurodevelopment, that may be answered by a Randomized Controlled Trial.

Title
  Skin-to-skin (kangaroo) holding of the intubated premature infant.
Abstract
  Skin-to-skin holding has been reported to be a useful technique for helping mothers feel close to their nonintubated infants hospitalized in the NICU. This article describes our experience with skin-to-skin holding of 25 intubated infants in the NICU. We found this technique was safe for the intubated infant and promoted parental attachment, even in parents who were at high risk for attachment impairments. Our experience suggests that skin-to-skin holding with small intubated infants may offer some parents an effective method to overcome some of the barriers to attachment imposed by the infant's hospitalization. In addition, our observations raise several questions regarding parent-infant interaction.

Title
  Skin-to-skin contact beginning in the delivery room for Colombian mothers and their preterm infants.
Abstract
  To determine if the transition to extrauterine life is facilitated by skin-to-skin contact, six relatively low risk preterm infants experienced six continuous hours of skin-to-skin contact on their mothers' chests beginning within 30 minutes of birth. Heart and respiratory rates and oxygen saturation remained within normal limits and all infant temperatures rose rapidly to thermoneutral range. Two infants developed grunting respirations by the time skin-to-skin contact began, but the grunting disappeared with warm, humidified oxygen and continuous skin-to-skin contact. All infants were fully breastfeeding and ready for discharge by 24-48 hours postbirth. Early skin-to-skin contact was safe and seemed beneficial for these relatively low risk preterm infants.

Title
  Selected physiologic measures and behavior during paternal skin contact with Colombian preterm infants.
Abstract
  A descriptive study of eleven healthy preterm infants was conducted in which cardiorespiratory (heart and respiratory rates, oxygen saturation), thermal (abdominal, toe and tympanic temperatures) and state behavior responses to two hours of paternal skin-to-skin contact within the first 17 hours of birth in Colombia, South America were evaluated. Infant physiologic and behavioral state measures were recorded each minute as was paternal skin temperature and behavior. Infant heart and respiratory rates increased during paternal contact as did abdominal and core temperatures. Fathers were able to keep their infants sufficiently warm, and five infants became hyperthermic (tympanic temperature greater than 37.5 degrees C) despite cooling measures while being held in this climate. Infants slept most of the time while being held and fathers seldom gazed at, spoke to, or touched their infants while holding them. When mothers are unavailable, fathers may be an alternate source of warmth and comfort to infants.

Title
  Physiologic responses to skin-to-skin contact in hospitalized premature infants.
Abstract
  Twelve stable premature infants in open-air cribs acted as their own controls in a study designed to evaluate the effect of skin-to-skin contact (SSC) with their mothers on infant heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and skin temperature. Measurements were taken every minute during three consecutive interfeeding periods (2 to 3 hours each): pre-SSC, SSC, and post-SSC. Skin-to-skin contact in the upright position between maternal breasts underneath a velour blouse occurred in the continuing care nursery of secondary level NICUs and was compared with infants lying in open-air cribs. All physiologic measures remained within normal limits, suggesting that SSC had no adverse effects. Statistically significant increases in heart rate and skin and rectal temperatures during SSC were also within normal limits. Skin-to-skin contact can occur between hospitalized stable premature infants and their mothers without physiologic compromise and heat loss to the infant. Practice implications are discussed.

Title
  Energy conservation during skin-to-skin contact between premature infants and their mothers.
Abstract
  The effects of skin-to-skin contact on three indexes of energy expenditure: heart rate, activity level, and behavioral state, were examined in a pilot study. It was hypothesized that skin-to-skin contact, because of its soothing effects, would increase sleep, lower activity level, and reduce heart rate. Eight healthy preterm infants in a neonatal intensive care unit, who had reached 34 to 36 weeks gestation, experienced one session of skin-to-skin contact for an interfeeding interval. Observations were made once each minute using continuous videotape throughout three consecutive interfeeding intervals (before, during, and after skin-to-skin contact). Significant treatment effects were found by repeated-measures analysis of variance for behavioral state and activity level; pair-wise comparisons showed that quiet sleep frequency was significantly increased and activity level reduced during skin-to-skin contact. Infants had longer durations of quiet sleep during skin-to-skin contact. The Pearson product-moment correlation between heart rate and behavioral state was robust and generally linear, supporting use of heart rate as a measure of energy expenditure in these subjects. The findings suggest that skin-to-skin contact is a simple, cost-effective intervention that reduces activity and state-related energy expenditure.

Title
  Oxygenation, heart rate and temperature in very low birthweight infants during skin-to-skin contact with their mothers.
Abstract
  Fourteen very low birthweight infants were studied positioned either prone horizontal or skin-to-skin at 60 degree tilt between the mother's breasts. Heart rate, skin temperature and oxygenation by transcutaneous PO2 and pulse oximetry were measured. Nine of the infants had normal lungs when studied. These infants showed no change in tcPO2 or oxygen saturation but heart rate increased significantly by a mean of 6.5 beats per min during skin-to-skin contact. Five infants with chronic lung disease, including two on nasal catheter oxygen, showed a significant 1.0 kPa rise in tcPO2 during skin-to-skin contact. Back skin temperature was well maintained during skin-to-skin contact with the room temperature at 26 to 29 degrees C. None of the infants had a significant apnoea or bradycardia during the study. Stable very low birthweight infants can enjoy such close contact with their mothers and the tilted position may improve pulmonary function in some cases.

Title
  Rewarming preterm infants on a heated, water filled mattress.
Abstract
  Sixty low birthweight infants (1000-2000 g) admitted to a neonatal care unit in Turkey were studied. Those not requiring intensive care were randomly assigned for treatment either in a cot on a heated, water filled mattress kept at 37 degrees C (n = 28) or in air heated incubators with a mean air temperature of 35 degrees C (n = 32). On admission 53 (88.3%) of the infants had body temperatures between 30 degrees and 36 degrees C. There was good correlation between axillary and rectal temperatures in the infants while they were hypothermic. Normal temperatures were achieved within the first day and remained within this range during the subsequent days after admission in all the infants treated on the heated, water filled mattress, whereas they were not achieved until three days later in the incubator group. The neonatal mortality among those treated on the heated, water filled mattress was 21%, and among those treated in the incubator 34%. The heated, water filled mattress provides a good alternative to skin to skin contact with the mother, and to the use of a complex and expensive incubator for rapidly attaining and maintaining normal temperatures in the low birthweight newborn.

Title
  Skin-to-skin contact as a method of body warmth for infants of low birth weight.
Abstract
  Skin-to-skin mother/infant contact as a means of warmth for newborns of low birth weight (less than or equal to 2500 g) was studied in 132 infants admitted consecutively during the cold season July/September at the Central Hospital in Maputo. The mean (+/- SD) birth weight was 1788 g (+/- 304 g) and the gestational age 34 weeks (+/- 2.7). Fifty-seven (43 per cent) infants were born outside the hospital and were referred. The ambient temperature ranged from less than 22 degrees C to 32 degrees C. Skin-to-skin contact as the principal means of warmth commenced in more than a third by age 3 days and in more than a half by age 5 days after periods of observation to exclude clinical problems. The infants were kept warm using conventional methods during observation. Re-admission to the intensive care unit was required in nine cases: four for diarrhoea; two for respiratory infection; two with jaundice; and one for poor suckling. Infants were discharged home at a mean (+/- SD) weight of 1864 g (+/- 227), and age 15.6 d (+/- 7.9). Skin-to-skin contact, either by itself or in combination with other methods of warmth, was reportedly followed at home by 67 per cent of the mothers who received home visits. No infant needed readmission for hypothermia either from the neonatal wards or after being discharged home. At follow-up, when body weight had reached greater than or equal to 2500 g, the outcome was graded as 'good' in 64; 'satisfactory' in 6; and 'poor' in 4.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Title
  Skin to skin contact for very low birthweight infants and their mothers.
Abstract
  Separation between mothers and very low birthweight infants is often prolonged with subsequent psychological distress, behaviour problems, and lactation failure. Babies as small as 700 g, who no longer require oxygen, can be safely and enjoyably held naked, except for a nappy, between the mother's breasts for up to four hours a day. We have carried out a randomised trial among babies less than 1500 g. Seventy one infants were randomised. In 35, the mother was helped to hold her baby in skin to skin contact and encouraged to do so whenever she visited the baby. In 36, the mother was encouraged to handle her baby but without skin to skin contact. Mothers using skin to skin contact lactated for four weeks longer on average than the control group. At 6 months of age the infants who had skin to skin contact cried significantly less than the control group. Skin to skin contact can safely and enjoyably be offered to very low birthweight infants especially in developing countries where the mother's lactation is vital.

Title
  Imipenem/cilastatin therapy for serious infections in neonates and infants.
Abstract
  Sixty-one hospitalized infants aged one day to six months were enrolled in an open, multicenter noncomparative clinical study of the efficacy and safety of imipenem/cilastatin. Patients weighing less than 1500 g (four males/ten females, Group 1) and those greater than or equal to 1500 g (31 males/16 females, Group 2) were analyzed separately. Total daily dose (divided into b.i.d. (27) or t.i.d. (34) regimens) ranged from 50 to 101.4 mg/kg given for 10.8 days (means, range 2 to 35 days) for Group 1 and 39.7 to 103 mg/kg given for 11.2 days (means, range 1 to 41 days) for Group 2. The investigators graded the intensity of signs and symptoms of infections as moderate or severe in 86 and 91% of patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively, and bacterial pathogens were isolated pretreatment in 43 and 32% of patients. Eighty-eight percent of all bacterial pathogens were susceptible to imipenem in vitro. The most commonly isolated pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Patients who had confirmed bacterial infections and who did not receive concomitant antibiotics were considered evaluable for efficacy, including 6 (43%) in Group 1 and 15 (32%) in Group 2. Infection sites were (Group 1) respiratory (100%), and (Group 2) skin and skin structures (33%), urinary (11%), gastrointestinal (11%), septicemia alone (11%) and meningitis or respiratory (28% and 6% with sepsis, respectively). Safety analysis included all patients. Imipenem/cilastatin was well tolerated in 93% of Group 1 and 85% of Group 2 patients. Three patients' treatments were discontinued due to rash, oliguria or poor local tolerability. Three patients in Group 1 and four in Group 2 died; deaths were considered unrelated to imipenem/cilastatin. Results are as follows: (table; see text) In summary, 81% (17 of 21) of evaluable patients were clinically cured or improved, among whom 3 of 21 patients (14%) had serious clinical or laboratory adverse experiences which were considered possibly related to imipenem/cilastatin. These results are comparable to results reported with other single or multiple antibiotic regimens.

Title
  Myth of the marsupial mother: home care of very low birth weight babies in Bogota, Colombia.
Abstract
  Because of the shortage of equipment and staff and the frequency of cross-infection in hospital, paediatricians at San Juan de Dios Hospital, Bogota, have been sending home babies weighing as little as 700 g, cared for between the mother's breasts in a vertical position and fed only on mother's milk ("kangaroo babies"). Infants as immature as 32 weeks gestation were successfully cared for at home in this way. Mother's milk was supplemented with guava juice and later with soup, but mean time to regain birth weight was 36 days. The previously publicised high survival figures for this home-care programme were found to be misleading because they omitted babies who had died in the first few days after birth. Although this approach is valuable in developing countries, home care of very low birth weight babies would not improve survival in industrialised nations. Nevertheless, care of such tiny infants in special care baby units in developed countries could benefit from similar emphasis on education and motivation of mothers and early skin-to-skin contact.

Title
  Pathogenesis and treatment of infant skin strawberry hemangiomas: clinical and in vitro studies of hormonal effects.
Abstract
  Corticosteroid treatment of infant strawberry hemangiomas produced premature regression of growing lesions in patients less than a year of age, but not in patients with cavernous or port-wine hemangiomas. Abnormally elevated serum estradiol-17 beta levels were found in strawberry hemangiomas, fourfold higher than in control, cavernous, and port-wine hemangiomas which were adjusted for age and sex of the patients. Specific estradiol-17 beta receptor binding activity was studied in biopsy tissues obtained from normal prepubertal skin and skin from various kinds of hemangiomas. Minimal specific estradiol-17 beta binding activity was detected in tissues of normal skin and involuting strawberry, cavernous, or port-wine hemangiomas. Abnormally high levels of specific estradiol-17 beta binding sites were demonstrated by receptor assays and by in vitro tissue culture technique in nine tissue samples obtained from strawberry hemangiomas, seven of which responded definitely or probably to corticosteroid therapy. The in vitro estradiol-17 beta binding activity in these tissue explants was inhibited by low (5 micrograms/ml) and high (100 micrograms/ml) doses of cortisone. The present data seem to suggest that there may be a causal relationship between the presence of elevated serum E2 and specific estradiol-17 beta receptors in the pathogenesis of strawberry hemangiomas and in response to corticosteroid treatment of the hormone-sensitive hemangiomas.

Title
  Barrier properties of the newborn infant's skin.
Abstract
  The barrier properties of the skin were examined in 223 studies in 70 newborn infants of 25 to 41 weeks' gestation, aged from 1 hour to 26 days. Percutaneous drug absorption was studied by observing the blanching response to solutions of 1% and 10% phenylephrine applied to a small area of abdominal skin. Skin water loss was measured at the same site using an evaporimeter. Infants of 37 weeks' gestation or more showed little or no drug absorption and had low skin water losses, indicating that their skin is an effective barrier. By contrast, infants of 32 weeks' gestation or less showed marked drug absorption and high skin water losses in the early neonatal period, indicating that their skin is defective as a barrier. Both drug absorption and water loss in these infants fell steadily; by about 2 weeks of age the skin of the most immature infants functioned like that of mature infants. The varying barrier properties can be explained by the poor development of the stratum corneum in the more premature infants at birth and its rapid maturation after birth. The trauma caused to the skin by use of adhesive tape and the fixation of transcutaneous oxygen electrodes resulted in increased drug absorption and water loss from the damaged area.

  Arterial occlusion in a preterm infant. Successful non-surgical treatment with urokinase and low-dose heparin.
Abstract
  Neonatal arterial occlusion is a rare condition of obscure aetiology, when not associated with catheterization of the umbilical artery. Embolic occlusion of the left iliac artery was diagnosed in a preterm baby weighing 1000 g, who presented with a cold, pale and pulseless left leg on the 6th day of life. Surgical embolectomy was contraindicated in this very small baby. Fibrinolytic therapy with urokinase and administration of low-dose heparin resulted in a complete recovery of skin colour, skin temperature and blood pressure. After three weeks of urokinase therapy, no pulse differences could be detected between right and left femoral and popliteal arteries by Doppler examination, and only minimal differences were present between right and left tibial arteries.

Title
  Effects of low humidity on small premature infants in servocontrol incubators. I. Decrease in rectal temperature.
Abstract
  19 small premature infants in servocontrol incubators, whose abdominal skin temperature was 36.0 +/- 0.3 degrees C, were subjected to alternate high- and low-humidity environments. With low humidity, rectal temperature dropped significantly below abdominal skin temperature. Skin was the predominant site of evaporative heat loss. The temperature was lower on naked skin than on an area covered by adhesive tape. Thus, servocontrol with low humidity increases evaporative heat loss and engenders a cycle of events that results in paradoxical body temperature decrease as the incubator temperature increases.
