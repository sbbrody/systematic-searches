Search OVID MEDLINE
using strings from cADTH (RCT) and pregnancy (CHLA) and vitamin D (Roth et al. 2017)
Retrieved 1,324 after excluding animal studies using traditional NOT line
Then, I tried running the Roth et al. search, up to line 18 and retrieved 3,454...
Why so many more?
I looked at the table in Appendix 5 to find articles to check my work - of the articles included in the original Roth article, which would be captured by this new search?
I found 5 (from page 1, Kaur, J is not in MEDLINE)
I checked one more on the next page and was able to find that, too. (Sahu)
tried a few more at random and I was still able to find them
Roth et al. 2017 likely started with a broader search, e.g. included intervention*, supplement* and then had to limit back whereas I didn't start with as broad of a net so did not have as great a need for the limits
The issue here is that if we want to take this search forward we can't use the exact same search because, by using NOT, we end up missing a key new article...
Based on the notes from the 5/31 meeting, need to search 2017 on using the Roth strategy and only those they would have missed using NOT for the pre-2017
SO
use a modified search (e.g. up through line 18)
run modified Roth search with limit > 20170901.dt. (maybe somewhat earlier for a cushion / overlap in case, for instance, something was created in august but not assigned mesh until septebmer 2017, then it's create date would be august but it's entry date september and if it is only findable by mesh it would not be captured by this limit...
Then run modified Roth search NOT (original Roth) < 20170901.dt. to capture articles that were excluded...
think through exact date limits...
Roth search through line 18 https://proxygw.wrlc.org/login?url=http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&NEWS=N&PAGE=main&SHAREDSEARCHID=5jeBt0BMcwWzn1QOnIUVEwKZQpkOgKPapYCLv3ThuHINvowenkTJgod9yfUleNNKa
limiting to the past few years since the search https://proxygw.wrlc.org/login?url=http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&NEWS=N&PAGE=main&SHAREDSEARCHID=280khZgv6ruQWyfZb3SgQUP8etOKOoh6sQviyXpQ4u6XzoyoCG2Gb3UUTAHtsVp8g 
still yields 1356, ~ the same as my newly constructed search so you wouldn't save too much time here
and those NOTs make me nervous about missing key articles....
could modify the nots?
alternatively, if the team has their original files, we could deduplicate in EndNote...
Am I really missing something important with the newly constructed string?
What if I selectively use the not function?
Let me look through the results of the post-2017 articles found using the modified string...
It looks like the "supplement" line (line 3) adds some noise...
If we remove that line...
