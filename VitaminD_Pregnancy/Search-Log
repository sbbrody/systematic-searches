Search OVID MEDLINE
using strings from cADTH (RCT) and pregnancy (CHLA) and vitamin D (Roth et al. 2017)
Retrieved 1,324 after excluding animal studies using traditional NOT line
Then, I tried running the Roth et al. search, up to line 18 and retrieved 3,454...
Why so many more?
I looked at the table in Appendix 5 to find articles to check my work - of the articles included in the original Roth article, which would be captured by this new search?
I found 5 (from page 1, Kaur, J is not in MEDLINE)
I checked one more on the next page and was able to find that, too. (Sahu)
tried a few more at random and I was still able to find them
Roth et al. 2017 likely started with a broader search, e.g. included intervention*, supplement* and then had to limit back whereas I didn't start with as broad of a net so did not have as great a need for the limits
The issue here is that if we want to take this search forward we can't use the exact same search because, by using NOT, we end up missing a key new article...
