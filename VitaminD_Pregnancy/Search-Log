Search OVID MEDLINE
using strings from cADTH (RCT) and pregnancy (CHLA) and vitamin D (Roth et al. 2017)
Retrieved 1,324 after excluding animal studies using traditional NOT line
Then, I tried running the Roth et al. search, up to line 18 and retrieved 3,454...
Why so many more?
I looked at the table in Appendix 5 to find articles to check my work - of the articles included in the original Roth article, which would be captured by this new search?
I found 5 (from page 1, Kaur, J is not in MEDLINE)
I checked one more on the next page and was able to find that, too. (Sahu)
tried a few more at random and I was still able to find them
Roth et al. 2017 likely started with a broader search, e.g. included intervention*, supplement* and then had to limit back whereas I didn't start with as broad of a net so did not have as great a need for the limits
The issue here is that if we want to take this search forward we can't use the exact same search because, by using NOT, we end up missing a key new article...
Based on the notes from the 5/31 meeting, need to search 2017 on using the Roth strategy and only those they would have missed using NOT for the pre-2017
SO
use a modified search (e.g. up through line 18)
run modified Roth search with limit > 20170901.dt. (maybe somewhat earlier for a cushion / overlap in case, for instance, something was created in august but not assigned mesh until septebmer 2017, then it's create date would be august but it's entry date september and if it is only findable by mesh it would not be captured by this limit...
Then run modified Roth search NOT (original Roth) < 20170901.dt. to capture articles that were excluded...
think through exact date limits...
Roth search through line 18 https://proxygw.wrlc.org/login?url=http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&NEWS=N&PAGE=main&SHAREDSEARCHID=5jeBt0BMcwWzn1QOnIUVEwKZQpkOgKPapYCLv3ThuHINvowenkTJgod9yfUleNNKa
limiting to the past few years since the search https://proxygw.wrlc.org/login?url=http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&NEWS=N&PAGE=main&SHAREDSEARCHID=280khZgv6ruQWyfZb3SgQUP8etOKOoh6sQviyXpQ4u6XzoyoCG2Gb3UUTAHtsVp8g 
still yields 1356, ~ the same as my newly constructed search so you wouldn't save too much time here
and those NOTs make me nervous about missing key articles....
could modify the nots?
alternatively, if the team has their original files, we could deduplicate in EndNote...
Am I really missing something important with the newly constructed string?
What if I selectively use the not function?
Let me look through the results of the post-2017 articles found using the modified string...
It looks like the "supplement" line (line 3) adds some noise...
If we remove that line...
So, comparing the articles we retrieve by including versus not including that line

Looking again at Roth et al.'s strategy I see another issue I am very concerned about
(pig* or rat* or rodent* or mouse* or mice).tw.
This excludes articles with words like rate, rates, etc. in the text, e.g. 
Diogenes ME, Bezerra FF, Rezende EP, Taveira MF, Pinhal I, Donangelo CM. Effect of calcium plus vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy in Brazilian adolescent mothers: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Am J Clin Nutr. 2013;98(1):82-91. doi:10.3945/ajcn.112.056275, 10.3945/ajcn.112.056275
These are common enough words that to exclude them seems problematic. 
The new search retrieves two publications related to clinical trials identified in the original Roth review (2018 O'Callaghan , American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, and 2021 Alhomaid, American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. )

Translated MEDLINE search to PubMed and appended string to restrict to those that may be missed in MEDLINE
Retrieves 165 results, including some not-yet-indexed animal studies. 
May update search a bit to clean it up, but overall I think PubMed is good to go. 
Started updating the Scopus translation from the Polyglot translation but not yet complete

Working on Scopus search 
Trying to NOT animal studies
Is it worth trying this filter?

Trying to fix up the Scopus search. Sent questions to Tom for another set of eyes on the "NOT" section. 
Also starting to work on Cochrane Library / CENTRAL search. 
Using the basics of pregnancy AND vitamin D. It is advised to NOT use filters for RCTs, humans in CENTRAL, since the database is already curated. 
However, Roth et al. did use such filters. 
I also tested a new Vitamin D search strategy but the two additional terms (hydroxycholecalciferol* OR colecalciferol*) did not yield anything new and relevant in CENTRAL, Scopus, or Medline. Seem to be used more often in vet/animal science.
